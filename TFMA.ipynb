I asked where did he get that figure from and he said it \\'s allegedly what I owe plus fees. He further indicated that I committed fraud and that Ace will pursue me if I did n\\'t make a payment that day. I asked him to clarify what he meant by pursue and he said that ACE would levy my bank accounts and paychecks. I mistakenly made a payment without researching his company which he failed to mention at the beginning of the call. He said I could settle the account by paying {$270.00} and I asked for an email stating that the account is resolved and that there would be no further obligation. I called back on XXXX XXXX because I had n\\'t received the email. He said he would have his administrator send it in that moment. That e-mail never showed which is when I became suspicious. The number he called from was unlisted. I called XXXX and was told I allegedly owe {$250.00}, they had no idea who XXXX ( entity listed as taking the payment ) is and that a company called XXXX XXXX is handling the case but it could also be resolved on their website. I called my card company to start a chargeback and the company has refused to reverse the payment from XXXX attempts so far. I have been getting calls since then from XXXX XXXX which are saved to my voicemail. He XXXX stated I need to tell my sister there \\'s a problem with the payment. My sister has nothing to do with this situation. In the second call he says there \\'s an attempt for a chargeback to call back. Today XXXX XXXX, the number he calls from shows up on my caller ID as Executive Acquisition and when I look up the number it \\'s a cell phone. This time he says \\\" they are going to press charges because you gave them a fake checking account and you committed fraud \\'\\'. This is indefinitely a false accusation. He does n\\'t even say XXXX so who is he referring to when he says they? In addition, he fails to say his name or where he \\'s calling from but I recognize his voice because he \\'s the only person who \\'s been calling. At this point I do n\\'t know who this company is or who they are representing. I \\'ve also seen other complaints about all three of the above mentioned companies with the exception of XXXX. I want my {$270.00} back and will deal with XXXX directly. I need help to stop these people and get my money back.  \"\n",

I did n\\'t find out this information until a year later after it was on my credit. I contacted the credit agency and make payment arrangements to pay in full. When making my second payment they asked me about a bankruptcy I said i knew nothing about it and they took my payment. They took my XXXX and XXXX payments. When making XXXX \\'s payment they would n\\'t even talk to me because there was a bankruptcy on file and said I was unable to make additional payments and they were not able to even speak to me about the account and hung up. I \\'ve tried several time to to contact them. I was never included in the bankruptcy. My uncle filed the bankruptcy. I just need it off my credit ill make payments. I do n\\'t understand how they knew about it when they took the XXXX XXXX payments but now I ca n\\'t do a thing with it. The Mortgage company told us this is the only thing keeping me and my fiance from getting a house.

I phoned ditech and told them that I received an overage check from my insurance company and that the amount actually owed was only {$870.00}. I told them I would send the paid receipt so they can re-adjust my escrow account and they refused to accept that. The customer service for this company is very rude including a manager who I asked for who was also no help. Also on my disclosure my current escrow is for {$400.00} and my new payment escrow is {$390.00} plus escrow shortage of {$81.00} does this make since no.  \"\n",

After the bankruptcy was granted we approached Well Fargo for a loan modification as we had a 6 3/4 % loan from XXXX. We were denied this request as we were current in our payments.We were told we would have to miss payments before they would talk to us. We stopped payments. Within XXXX months we got a call from WF about the payments at which time re requested a loan Mod, we were put in contact with that dept. and after time. denied a Mod.

They have even contacted my ex-husband and told him that I owe for a bill and that he will be in trouble on a Federal level if I am not found immediatley. My Ex and I were married in the XX/XX/XXXX and have been divorced for over XXXX years. Just today they called my brother in law and threatened him on a \\\" Federal Level \\'\\' and that HIS credit will be affected in a very negative way. He asked that they not call him anymore. He has had several calls from them in the past, but today \\'s call got especially ugly. The number that called him today was XXXX. I spoke to the company over a year and a half ago and explained to them that I felt I had resolved this issue with them by paying back what I had origanlly borrowed before they decided to tack on all kinds of fees and so called court costs. I also explained that I was not working at the time and still am not because I have XXXX.I am or have not been hiding out from these people. They have also called my work several times and told my boss my business or at least their illusion of what my business is. They also told her that I will be served at work. I never have been still to this day. If they are going to serve me or arrest me then why have they not done this yet?? They have humiliated me in front of my boss and my co-workers by constantly calling while we were trying to run a business. They have also called my daughter who has been out of the house, married and on her own for the last XXXX years and has gotten her terribly upset. It is humiliating trying to explain to my family, friends, boss and co workers that I have n\\'t done anything wrong and do not believe that I will be arrested.I have never recieved anything by mail from them and no one has ever shown up at work when I was employed. Like I said I have never been hiding out, why do they keep calling and harrasing people that I know or have known in the past?? Like I said before I have a lot on my plate right now with the XXXX and all and going through treatment and DO NOT need this added extra stress in what I have left of my life.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"I had XXXX loan agreements with Lendmark Financial in XX/XX/XXXX. I ran into some money issues and both accounts went in default. in early XX/XX/XXXX an judgement was granted in favor of Lendmark Financial and the account was soon charged off. I talked to an Attorney and it was discovered that when the judgement was granted, the account was no longer active. ( In other words the judgement would remain on my credit report for 7 years from that day ). The judgement did indeed stay on credit reports for 7 years and was taken off. However, the items still remain on my credit reports ( all XXXX ). I fell strongly that Lendmark Financial has altered the roll off dates to keep the items on my report. ( the dates do not match on the credit reports ). I have contacted the company and reporting agencies numerous time and nothing was done. To sum it up My complaint is that the judgement was removed after seven years but the charge-offs remained. ( they are offset ) and unfairly doing damage to my credit. I think the charge-offs should be taken off just as the judgments were taken off after 7 years. The judgments actually happened before the charge-offs  \"\n",

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, Honor health sent me to collections the same day because I refused to make formal payment arrangements. The collection agency will not take payments said I had to talk to the Hosp. the Hosp will not take payments because they turned it over to collections. I only had 2 payments left and no one can decide where I should send them. The collection agency and Hosp want the full amount. I was told that XXXX XXXX REQUIRES a patient to set up payment arrangements. Can they demand full payment? I figured I \\'d have this paid off in less than 6 months actually it would be 4 months so a payment arrangement contract did n\\'t seem necessary. But now no one wants the MONEY. The per diem charge was new in XXXX usually we had a co-pay it came as a great surprise that now we have a per diem. They have me delinquent because the charge was for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX even though I did n\\'t get a bill until XXXX XXXX. Is it true that even if you make your payments you can still be sent to collections? it seems a bit odd that a creditor would rather take 50 % than the entire balance. If they are willing to take 50 % I could do that.. Do n\\'t know what to do now, I had planned to send the Hosp, XXXX on the XXXX of XXXX, but I am being told that the Hosp and Collection agency can not accept the payment. It used to be that if a payment was refused by the creditor the creditor risked having the debt cancelled, has that changed? XXXX citizens have enough problems we do n\\'t need any more.  \"\n",

Today I was told I did not make enough money. I questioned further and this supposed calculation was without the requested loan modification. He said I did not send in supporting documentation, but I have not been asked to submit supporting documentation. This process has become so convoluted, that each \\\" Home Loan Team member \\'\\' does not know what each other has been doing and I believe that Bank of America has been making this process so difficult in order to make it impossible for me to keep my property. I can not get a lower interest rate for this loan and now I have been told that I can not get a loan modification. This loan was originated by Countrywide Home Loans and I believe that this was a predatory loan. I have contacted the funding company, who is Bank XXXX XXXX which this was never disclosed to me XXXX. It appears that Bank of America would rather keep the extra {$500.00} per month that I believe I am entitled to in order to keep my property. This loan was funded before interest rates decreased : 7.12 % and I have been trying for years to refinance and now modify without success and have been given numerous reasons during these processes. I do not want to lose this property and have done everything that I can to keep up on the payments. Please help me.  \"\n",

However, the item continue to be incorrect as the fee was paid as evidence by the copy of my receipt and letter from the court below. In addition, I understand that paid tax liens must be removed after seven years from a record. This has been reporting now for 9 years.

I got an email from XXXX XXXX stating that the bank statement did n\\'t verify ( it was a joint account ). SO I gave them my other account with a small credit union XXXX. I got a letter signed from the people at the bank verifying that is was my account. 4 days later I got an email saying they could n\\'t verify my identity and they denied me XX/XX/XXXX.   No one gave me a chance or ask me to provide anything more. I gave drivers license, birth certificate, social security and they ran my credit.   I called and they could n\\'t tell me anything as to why they could n\\'t verify because it look good on their side. Then they told me to reapply.   I thought this as strange as most companies do n\\'t allow you keep applying.   I applied again anyway to see. XX/XX/2015 I applied again.  XX/XX/XXXX. I signed the documents on XX/XX/XXXX. I got an email stating my loan was approved. I called and spoke to customer service several times and they all said keep checking my account the funds will be in there. Give it 3-4 days. 5 days later they said because I have a smaller credit union it may take sometime. I called yesterday and they said that is hould be in my account no later than XX/XX/2015. I checked the sofi today and it is saying my account is withdrawn.   I am so confused I never withdrew the loan and I feel like it was all a game to give me the run around. When I normally am approved for something and they say funds with be in account that is usually the case. I am not sure if this is a legit company. I have been nothing but patient and this feel like this is a scamIf the money was going to my account and I had been approved and the several customer service agents state the money would be in my account how did it go to withdraw status.   I never got anything as to why the loan was in withdraw status. They said it was something that could n\\'t be verified. If this is the case how did I sign loan and then they said it was not able to verify things. NO one contacted me and tried to see if this could be resolved.   Also now I have XXXX unnecessary inquiries if they knew they were not going to approve me why have someone wait almost 3 months. This is very unprofessional.The representatives were so nice but I am not sure if this is a legit company or they just have you applying for nothing or to get your information  \"\n",

XXXX XXXX has continued to place charges on my account without my knowledge and Synchrony Bank is accepting these charges that put my account OVER and above the credit limit I was approved for. This has happened more than 2 times and the last was for a charge of {$2200.00} of which I had no idea about until I got the credit card statement in the mail. Separately I have contacted XXXX XXXX regarding the validity of this charge ( and replacement for a defective furniture received ). I can not understand why Synchrony would approve these charges that are over and above my approved credit limit ( which is {$9700.00} ). When I called Synchrony to report the unauthorized / fraudulent charge of {$2200.00} I asked to speak to a Supervisor. She was extremely rude and said \\\" we can not control fraudulent charges made on a credit card \\'\\'. She refused to acknowledge that they could say NO when a charge is over and above the approved credit limit. I immediately requested my account be closed to further charges. They have since transferred that outstanding balance to a new account # and provided me with a new card ( for the new account of which I have no intention of activating ). My concern is that this amount that exceeds my credit limit is reported to the credit bureaus and will bring my credit scores down significantly since XXXX % of your sores is the ratio between your balance versus the limit. I do n\\'t feel they are taking this issue seriously and while I have filed a fraudulent complaint regarding the {$2200.00} I am very concerned with their practices which allows XXXX XXXX to charge anything they want to a consumer credit card with no protection or consideration to consumers best interest.  \"\n",

Once the money was deposited to their account, they withdrew the funds and closed the account.   XXXX XXXX XXXX got notice of a charge back under my company name and tried to recover the funds, but the account was closed. They are now contacting me and are claiming that I need to pay for this charge.   I let them know that I was completely unaware of this and never charge a single credit card on my merchant account ( I opened this account to allow my customers to make ACH payments to me - they are usually less than $ XXXX/month ). XXXX XXXX XXXX never even notified me that my bank account was changed and I did not authorize a change of my bank account at any time.   Obviously, the bank account was not opened in my name, as they must be opened in person with photo ID according to the Patriot Act. XXXX XXXX XXXX will not release to me the name of the person whose credit card initiated the charge back and they wo n\\'t give me the name of the bank and account # where the funds were deposited, so I have no way of knowing exactly how this even happened. I can report that I received an ACH deposit the Monday after this alleged credit card charge ( Father \\'s Day ), so this must have been a very quick change.   Since I did not initiate the change of this bank account information and did not make this charge, I should not be held accountable for it. I notified XXXX XXXX of this and they acknowledge it was probably fraud, yet they will do absolutely nothing on their end to investigate this fraud. They are only willing to proceed with collections against me, even though I had nothing no ability to control their security practices, which are obviously flawed.   On my end, I did file a police report of this fraud and a fraud report with the Federal Trade Commission. I continued to receive calls from XXXX XXXX XXXX demanding payment along with threats that they were going to send me to collections. I kept denying I made this charge, yet they still proceeded with collections. I just received my first collections notice from Consolidated Recovery Group, LLC and I responded that I am disputing this charge.  \"\n",

I have never had a 30 day late, and in XX/XX/XXXX the bank applied an incorrect posting on my account which I was not aware of, at this time we had a dispute with XXXX XXXX due to a program that was purchased when we bought our vehicle. The plan had included having Tires paid for up to a certain amount. When we went to utilize the plan we were told that they discontinued the plan but never notified the customers. We had been advised they could pay the additional amount of around XXXX some odd dollars to us directly for the inconvenience. We were not satisfied and we advise if we would of known this was going to occur we would not of wanted the plan, we did not agree that the funding of the loan should of been charged that additonal amount and be charged interest on that balance. When I saw the amount posted to the account I assumed that XXXX sent the amount straight to ALLY instead of us. I pay additonal amounts on my account every month. When I went to pay on the website the payments showed current, and I continued to monitor the website, I paid every month. The payment was removed from my account a while later causing the account to show delinquent. I was not aware, the website that I have made every payment to was not refreshed. This caused the payment to show being paid after 30 days, I was not notified on time and once I saw it was behind I paid the account current. This is causing them to report me for 3 months being over 30 days late which was caused by their website not being updated and giving me a clear paid to date. The account is never posted with the full amount and the extra funds that I send in does n\\'t give me a clear picture of how they are applying my funds. I have never had an issue with this institution but thier not taking responsiblity for their misposting is causing me a lot of grief with my credit reporting. I maintain good standing on all my accounts. I believe due to this error my credit has been ruined and I am not in agreement with companies being able to such things to customers. I have tried to contact them and they continue to not take responsiblity. They respond with generic responses and will not look at the situation seriously. The customer always loses in these situations and we are not treated as individuals, this company already has my money so what do they have to lose. I want everyone to know what a horrible company this is and to never get a loan with them.  \"\n",

Due to XXXX, I had to wait a couple of months to get back in contact to unflag my account.   XX/XX/XXXX, I called USAA to unflag my account, and this time they asked to authenticate me by a phone number. The phone number on the account is incorrect, and I was told that in order to change it, that I needed to log in on USAA.com to change it. That would work, but my account is flagged, so this is impossible. I was told they would escalate my issue with a back department that would call me back in 24 hours. This never happened, and every time I called over the next XXXX weeks, I was told the same thing.   I finally decided to go to the USAA XXXX page to see if I could get better support from them. A lady named XXXX called me saying that I should call her extension to get the problem resolved.

Throughout this process, I \\'ve had XXXX and have not worked for the past XXXX months my husband is on XXXX, and we have decided to sell the property. We \\'ve been in escrow for the past XXXX months and granted a short sale approval several months ago. The buyer had problem financing the property because it was next to an oil pump, so they had to go with a new lender and was able to get financing. Our realtor asked Ocwen for new extension and was declining due to the Hud one not reflect the original payoff amount going to Ocwen, which was an error on escrows part. We made the corrections and still have not received it after XXXX months, and I \\'m being told now that I do not qualify for a short sale because I \\'d make too much, and they want to review my financial documents again but are asking me to resubmit everything again which I have already done and I was denied a modification. The buyer has spent money already on appraisals and have been very patient with us for the past XXXX months ; it appears Owen is just trying to foreclose and is not working in good faith. My Realtor has ask Ocwen, to send him in writing what they want at this point but they have n\\'t, and keep tell him they have submitted a request ... .that \\'s been for the XXXX weeks. I resubmitted everything Ocwen requested and still as of today my agent was told by Assigned Negotiator ( Agent ID XXXX ) what was requested by ( Agent ID XXXX ) on XXXX/XXXX/2015 was n\\'t correct and more was needed. He told my realtor, after my realtor explained to him he sent over exactly what was requested he would call him back tomorrow to double check. Also my realtor asked Ocwen, to send him in writing what was needed by fax or email and has not got anything sent. I was asked by my realtor to call on XXXX/XXXX/2015 to call and see if anything was still needed and I was told by ( Agent XXXX XXXX ID XXXX ) NOTHING was needed. My realtor called back XXXX minutes later and was told by Agent ID XXXX ) some documents were needed and that ( Agent XXXX XXXX ID XXXX ) tell me XXXX prior that these documents were needed, which is n\\'t true. They wanted me to explain the new financial statement because I should my husbands XXXX so they wanted an award letter showing it was his not mine and an explanation about my son he gives me {$700.00} a month cash for bills and food, everything was send by email to Ocwen on XXXX/XXXX/2015. My realtor got a call today by Assigned Negotiator ( Agent ID XXXX ) that Ocwen still need an award letter for Me and blank financial statement since I had no income? My realtor explained to him what was requested and there was no award letter for me because my husband not I that received XXXX, he also ask why are they asking for something different today then from last XXXX and all we needed was and extension because short sale was already approved. He put my realtor on hold and told him he \\'ll call him tomorrow, my realtor again ask to send all request in writing by fax or email, and why have n\\'t he received it yet after XXXX months. His response was he is the Assigned Negotiator but can only communicate by phone and had to request it be sent by other department, and would take XXXX to XXXX hour. But that \\'s what he \\'s been told when he request they send what they need in writing. Please see attach Short sale approval letter, Request for extension, Denial of short sale extension due to income being to high and payoff to low, copy of letter from Ocwen that I did n\\'t qualify for modification and short sale was my only option.

I felt that was inappropriate and rude. My instructor felt the same way when she asked what was bothering me once she saw my demeanor change. She reassured me that I for what we did for that day I was appropriate. I sent XXXX my resume approx. XXXX times with it being returned only once being altered. Even up into me updating my resume after completion of the XXXX program. I was allowed to get kicked out of my externship site at the small XXXX practice because I called out for the first time with a XXXX. I tried to speak to XXXX regard concerns of my site a week prior to that incident. I had to wait approx. 2 weeks before I was able to find another site to complete XXXX hours of my externship to graduate. I spoke to the XXXX director, and her director, to the Director of Education and then to the Dean. I still have not gotten proper leadership and/or any concerns of my future from any of them. I have n\\'t been instructed to perform an mock interview to see if I \\'m even ready for an interview in the field, my resume have n\\'t been properly reviewed and addressed in follow-up. And as completion of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, now XX/XX/XXXX I yet to receive my diploma. I got XXXX to see me when I went to the XXXX campus to see Financial Aid regarding disputing my loan, under false allegations & promises. Then I got the same subjected reactions of where I am right now a month and a half later of completion. Nothing!!!!  I witnessed a lot of unfortunate situations at that institute. But mines is that I applied ALL I had to get this and understand insurance and billing. Even though I have overall been in the XXXX field for 14 years, I have not had to work with any insurance with patients or even with the insurance companies.I \\'m hand-on patient care. In different classroom settings I heard on many separate occasions that we was in an advance program. I can agree to that.A lot of my classmates had a hard time following. I felt they should have had a proper screening of applicates of this program. It was very advance that in completion of the program XXXX felt we would n\\'t be able to get allowed to extern at any medical practice that would let us do their billing. On behalf of the relationships of the entire XXXX staff that was true. I was told during my extern when I was asked not to return to the XXXX office that my starting off at making XXXX hrly was to high.I also explained that was where I was now. So why would I take a big cut in pay with on top of having 14 years in the field?!? I stated to her then if I was told that when I signed up for the XXXX program I would not have done this program at all. I have even went to spend out more money to take a certification test just to maybe help my chances in getting hired and to make more money.  I do n\\'t think it is fair that I have n\\'t gotten any kind of resume support, job search help and ect of the understanding of me completing the program that I have to be in more debt!  \"\n",

When signing up, I was told as part of the marketing that I can manage my account and pay online.   When I went to sign up, I ran into multiple issues. First, I was unable to sign up because the online software would not display my phone number as they require multi-factor authentication. After that was resolved over the phone ( They said the issue was that they had my home number and my cell number as the same number ), I tried to continue. I reached the part of the sign-up process where I am to create the account name and password. Despite following the password rules, ( Uppercase, lower case characters and at least XXXX numbers, special characters allowed ), several potential passwords were rejected. Upon raising this issue with the company, they informed me that they only supported XXXX antiquated versions of XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX or XXXX. I do n\\'t have a way to easily downgrade XXXX, and I tried installing XXXX and I experienced even worse issues.   I find it dishonest and misleading that the bank would advertise online account management and make me jump though hoops to use it. There is no technical reason why this should n\\'t work fine - the browsers and standards that they refuse to support properly are not new and they have had plenty of time to write software that is compatible with them.  \"\n",

The total purchase price for both appliances was {$2700.00}.  These appliances were purchased for my new house where I did n\\'t move until XX/XX/XXXX.

I was told that my account is now current and as long as I made the full remaining balance on my account by the Expiration Date, I would no longer pay any interest.

While I made the full payment of {$2700.00} before expiration date and paid them late fees for the first couple missed payments, they have taken the wrongful action of closing my account and making derogatory submission to the credit bureaus, when the underlying cause of this was **their mistake** of having left over fees on my account.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"For the past 3 years, my mortgage company has been paying {$860.00} per year out of my escrow accounts towards what they \\'ve been refering to as a \\\" water tax \\'\\' or a \\\" water/sewer assessment \\'\\'. I \\'ve attempted more than once to get clarification on what they \\'re paying and every time they basically blow me off and tell me to get the information from my tax assessor. My local tax assessor \\'s office as well as the water company had advised me this tax does n\\'t exist and they had no idea what my mortgage company was paying. For the past 2 years my home was being renovated and unoccupied, so I did n\\'t have garbage service. This is my first year having garbage service and receiving a bill ... .for {$860.00}. A normal yearly garbage bill for a single family residence is {$430.00}, however the city was incorrectly billing my home as a duplex. When I received the bill and saw the amount, I realized that my mortgage company has been paying a garbage bill for the past 2 years that I should not have been getting billed for. Furthermore, they had no business paying for a utility out of my escrow account. My escrow account does not cover any of the other utilities for my home. Had they appropriately labled what they were issuing a payment for or been willing to provide me with any information on the payment, I could have dispute the charges with the city two years ago. As it stands, the city waste deparment has been overpaid {$2100.00} of my money. After speaking with the garbage department, they agreed that I should not have been billed for the past 2 years and did n\\'t owe the money, but it \\'s unlikely I \\'ll be able to get a refund due to the amount of time that \\'s passed. I submitted a request via e-mail to my mortgage company almost a month ago for information on the payments they were making. I received a generic reply that they would respond within 10 days. I \\'ve yet to receive a response. When I \\'ve tried to speak with someone over the phone for the past 2 years, I \\'m always told that the tax department ca n\\'t be reached by phone, only fax or e-mail.  \"\n",

This Loss Mitigation was approved for a four month trial period. We made our reduced payments every month during this trial. In XXXX Loan Care sent us a notice that we no longer qualified for the loss mitigation and that we owed the full amount in mortgage payments. They did not give us credit for the payments that we made during this four month trial period.

I noticed the charge on XXXX/XXXX/15 and immediately called to file a dispute. I received the paperwork to sign and returned it on XXXX/XXXX/15. The paperwork I signed was an affidavit that it was not my charge. I immediately placed the signed affidavit back in the mail in the postage paid envelope provided. I called on XXXX/XXXX/15 to find out when I would receive my provisional credit and I was told after 10 business days of the complaint. When talking with the customer service representative, we both agreed the credit would be posted to my account on XXXX/XXXX/15. She told me it would be later in the day. So, on XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX. I contacted Associated Bank to find out why I had not received the provisional credit. At that time I was told my signed paperwork was not received. I was also told the dispute area was closed so they would have to call me on Monday. And that I would not get provisional credit until 10 days AFTER the signed paperwork was received. They said they would re-mail me the documents for me to sign and it would be an additional 10 days AFTER they receive those documents that I would receive provisional credit!  It looks like the charge to my account is an ACH transaction that obviously was taken from the wrong account. Maybe {$350.00} is not a lot of money to them, but I need the {$350.00} that was incorrectly taken from my account to pay bills. The bank refuses to give me credit to the money that is mine.  \"\n",

I was told by the law firm to pay over {$1000.00} a month and I explained to them that I ca n\\'t afford it because I have other student loans and bills. Moreover, it is no that I do n\\'t want to pay but my income at the end of the month ca n\\'t meet the said amount. The law firm requested for my two month pay stub, tax returns and a letter which I submitted. I was told to call after two business days. When I called the law firm, I was told to pay {$700.00} for one year, {$1000.00} the second year and {$1500.00} for the subsequent years. I explained once again that it is not that I do n\\'t want to pay but my resources can not meet that payment plan. Unfortunately, I was told to pay with my husband assistance but I mentioned to them that my husband is currently still in school and besides that, he has his own student loans that he is struggling with.  I have tried several times to contact XXXX XXXX on phone per the response I received but no answer or return call to the messages I left. The law firm has informed me that Wells Fargo has filed a law suit against me and if I ca n\\'t pay what they are demanding from me, they will proceed with the court case.  Please, permit me to mention that I \\'m prepared and willing to pay any reasonable amount in consideration to my expenses which will be between $ XXXX $ XXXX request and appeal is to reduce the {$700.00} to reasonable payment plan that I will be committed.

The process server stated she was driving to the known residences of \\\" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' to serve lawsuit-related documents. I told her I was not XXXX XXXX ; I am XXXX XXXX, his son. She gave me two addresses which she was going to ; these were prior addresses of mine. Neither of these addresses has ever been the address of my father and I told her that ; she said she did n\\'t care. One of these addresses is the current address of my mother, who is divorced from my father. I was very concerned that this process server would show up at my mother \\'s house. I called the number given to me by the process server which is the number of Creekside Recovery and Capital Management. Creekside Recovery and Capital Management refused to identify themselves as Creekside Recovery and Capital Mangegment ; instead they used the term CRCM. They also refused to assure me they would double-check on whether the addresses they were sending a process server to were the appropriate address for XXXX XXXX. So they refused to assure me my mom would not be harassed at her home and they refused to assure me my former landlords would not be harassed at their homes. I have not lived with XXXX XXXX in over 10 years, have no connection to this matter, and believe I am entitled to assurance that no process server will be going to these addresses ( or at minimum that they would take some steps to double-check on where those addresses came from in their system XXXX. Furthermore, I believe it was inappropriate for them to identify themselves using an abbreviation when I asked them for the specific name of their company ; they used the same tactic when my mom spoke to them. In and of itself, this intentional misdirection concerning their identity is a form of harassment ; I had no way of knowing they were a real company and not a malicious group of scammers with private information about my family. Finally, they even threatened to sue me for calling them repeatedly to try to get their full name ; again I was only trying to get their full name to confirm they were a legitimate corporation so that I would not fear for our safety. I only found their name later using XXXX and it required multiple searches. Prior to finding their name I also submitted a complaint to the FTC with reference number XXXX do not talk with my father and do not want to be involved with him in any way ; that \\'s why this matter is disturbing to me. My mom also does not want any involvement with him or this matter but it has been imposed upon us by the aggressive tactics of CRCM and their contracted process server.  \"\n",

Please, I am asking just for a short postponement of our foreclosure dates so I can short sale it, perhaps salvage some of my credit when I get on my feet.

First, Central Financial Control have not, by any credible means, demonstrated that I owe this alleged debt to their organization. Central Financial Control have failed to provide any document bearing my signature that would establish that I have any indebtedness to their company.   Second, Central Financial Control have merely supplied me with copies of alleged bills on the account in question ( OR contract ). These documents, which Central Financial Control could easily have fabricated, failed to prove that there is any legal or contractual obligation between myself, their agency or the creditor.   Third, as Central Financial Control have failed to establish any relationship between me and the purported debt, I demand that Central Financial Control discontinue reporting this item to the credit bureaus and, in fact, that they delete the item. Additionally, note that if Central Financial Control continue to collect on this purported debt, such action will be in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.   Fourth, I did not appreciate the insulting tone that my validation request was answered in. I have a right to request ANY and ALL proof that I owe this alleged to Central Financial Control AND to the original creditor. Their answers were condescending and I advised them that I would report there negative response to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the XXXX. Central Financial Control hostility was completely uncalled for as I am acting within MY rights under the law.   To summarize, I DO NOT have any contractual obligation to pay Central Financial Control at this point Central Financial Control have failed to provide ANY credible proof that the alleged debt can be validated.

Around from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX I was on a duty XXXX. Upon my return a year later with no prior correspondence the collection company served my roommate. I showed up to court and made payment arrangements that were inflated with interests. While I was making payment, I called in and inquired about making a payment that consisted of a large sum to be distributed evenly across a number of months. The representative on the phone accepted the payment and they defaulted me the following month for non-payment. I was a student and not working, they placed a lien on my bank account. I had a lawyer submit a file to remove the lien and told them he would be representing me from that point forward. Since then, the attorney has n\\'t received neither calls nor correspondence from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, neither have I. On Monday XXXX XXXX, at about XXXX XXXX a sheriff showed up to my apartment with a court execution order to levy my property. He parked behind my car and forbade me to leave the premises without handing over my car keys unless I wrote him a check for {$4600.00}. I pleaded with them that this car is how I earn my income as a ride share driver, he called a town truck and impounded the car with a notice to resolve the matter in 45 days or the car would be sold. Since then I have filed a Notice to Defendant of Right Against Garnishment, Wages, Money, and Other Property. I contacted the collection agency and the person handling the case advised me to have my lawyer contact them. He has tried for the past three weeks and has n\\'t successfully spoken to anyone except for a secretary who told him someone will return his call. It appears I have n\\'t been giving any choice in this matter. I was under the impression they \\'d want their money but instead they rather have me suffer and not earning an income. I do n\\'t understand how this is justifiable. I \\'m going 21 days without my car. It \\'s costing me {$32.00} per day on average to travel to a per Diem job where I \\'m only earning {$85.00} before tax. My hands are tied at this point, I just want to resolve this issue.

XX/XX/XXXX our loan was transferred to Caliber Home loans, who recognized and accepted our new payment amount of XXXX. However, they failed to bring the account current, without our knowledge. Prior to our case being discharged, Caliber was sent a letter to notify the courts and trustee if there were any errors as we were due to be discharged. They did not respond. Our bankruptcy was discharged free and clear of any past due amounts. XX/XX/XXXX, Caliber contacted us and said we were XXXX behind and threatened to foreclose. They made us do a repayment plan to get caught us and NEVER HONORED OR RECOGNIZED THE modification to bring the account current, although we provided documentation. We have been struggling for11 months making double and triple payments on money that was not even due or owed. We want to keep our home and feel that Caliber did not honor what was approved by the courts and they failed to comply with the rules that a debtor needs to be notified prior to discharge of any discrepancy. We have suffered an enormous amount of stress and agony just to ensure we are back on track not to mention the house is over XXXX over the amount it is worth.

Since the approval letter came, the agent  XXXX, has put of sending someone to finish the loan.  it has been Eleven months and they still have not done anything.  XXXX, XXXX Supervisor has repeatedly said they will work things out but nothing has been done.  They asked me to reapply, I asked, \\\"At today\\'s rate and will you have the oppurtunity to reject my application?\\\"  He said that it was true and I told them that was not right and that since they made an original agreement they will honor it.  I told them that I was going to make a complaint to the CFPB but they acted like they did not care.  XXXX did not seem worried that I was  going to contact the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation where he must have his Illinois License through.  Carrington Mortgage Re-Finance out of their Florida Office is the place where XXXX and XXXX are located.  I have copies of the original application and the approval letter that show no dates of experation.  I think that they are just waiting for the year to run out so that they can again say, \\\"Well, it is too late to fix anything now!\\\"  About three or four months after I received the approval letter, and many phone calls to XXXX while he still worked at the California office, he admitted that the application had gotten lost on his desk but that he still wanted to work with me and get it pushed through even though he was moving to the Florida Office of Carrington Mortgage.  I was originally assured that this was going to be a smooth process but I was wrong.  All that I want is my original re finance to go through, that\\'s it and Carrington has made it miserabble since they screwed up and hope that I will go away.  The last call, almost two weeks ago, was to follow up on a statement made by XXXX that he would check and see if the dates on all of the documents be changed and updated, would that make the loan go through but I have not heard from him or XXXX.\"\n",

In the confusion, I inadvertantly missed XXXX payment, so each payment after for 3 months were also \\\" recorded as late \\'\\' until I caught my mistake and made a double payment in XX/XX/XXXX. I sent a request in writing to investigate and remove the inaccurate reporting in \\\" Good Will \\'\\' as I have always been on-time with my mortgage and considering the new information. I also added automated withdraw for all future mortgage payments, so it would n\\'t happen again. I received a form letter response indicating what could be done ; nothing, and it was attached to the previous response that was sent to me. I do not think my request or new information was even looked at, just a representative doing a lookup and then regenerating the form letter decision. This is also preventing any opportunity for refinance and a way for Wells Fargo to keep me at 7.375 % when the going rate for the past 2-3 yrs has been hovereing around 3.5 %. This is unfair and Im confident this failure to investigate violates Reg Z, UDAAP, and FCRA and the subsequent improvements to FCRA that occurred in XX/XX/XXXX, and my ability to secure a new loan and refinancing ( Reg B ). I am willing to pursue this issue to the letter of the law.  \"\n",

I still made a few payments after that trying to catch up but i just couldnt get back on track. This company also caused me alot of grief and stress as they would call my job to my BOSS \\'S DESK PHONE ... ..ALL.DAY.LONG! Even after he asked them to stop calling they still called and almost caused me to get fired. The called my MOTHER and scared her as well and she doesnt even live in this state asking her for my wherabouts! They even came in person to my house and were yelling at me in front of my kids.   This is very rude and unprofessional not to mention against collection laws. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX I paid them the balance IN FULL and requested as a coutresy for them to delete the reporting from the credit bureaus and they refused. I requested a call back from Manager XXXX who handles the Georgia offices XXXX times only to be ignored and never receive a call back. These people scared myself, my kids and jeopardized my job!

       "         value: \"American Eagle ( clothing company at XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ) ( 1 ) lies to customers about a discount that does n\\'t exist if you open a credit card with them, and ( 2 ) they never send the card so you pay fees. Also ( 3 ) they make up new excuses NOT to process the payment if you find a way to pay without having the card in your hand.   Number ( 1 ) I recorded their employees saying different discount amounts, and then admitting at the register the discount is not such AFTER we already had an argument about that the month before. That means they actively keep doing it. A customer after me ( XXXX XXXX ) was next in line asking for the 50 % discount I was offered too if we got the card, so it was n\\'t just \\\" my hearing \\'\\'.   ( 2 ) I applied for a card, and the cashier entered seemed not to enter my data in the computer, but the SS number retrieving the information from some credit DB. After confirming it was my address, I got approved the card and paid with it.   ( 3 ) Three weeks later I was not getting the card in the mail, so I found the way to PAY anyway online. The process showed \\\" successful \\'\\', but I never got an email about it.  Weeks later, no payment reflected in my bank statement, I CALLED them, and they could n\\'t find the account ( I paid online! ) so I wanted to know WHAT ADDRESS they had. Despite I gave all my info and it checked out ( at least the little info that GOT ME INTO THEIR CREDIT CARD did ), no supervisor was allowed to tell me what address was in their system for my SS number ( so they could make up excuses later ). I was ALREADY receiving mail offers from their company since I purchased there before, so they DID have my address, and the cashier processing my application HAD my ID in her hands to check the address and everything.   At the end, I had to give them my real info ( which could have caused a thief reposessing my account with whatever info he wanted ) and they just said \\\" oh, the address was this little letter off only \\'\\'. So my info was good enough to get a credit card, access the account and adding whatever I want as \\\" my info \\'\\' ( I could have been a thief ), but was not good enough to provide me with the address in file. Finally I asked them to \\\" send me the information that was there \\'\\' to my mailing address, the one matching the ID used to apply for the card, so only the owner would receive it, and they said they could n\\'t either.   After they fixed my info, because my account was NOT in their system anymore to pay online, they said I could pay by phone without fees so I did.   Now, I got a letter saying they DID apply a fee ( {$10.00} ) plus interests, which I could have avoided if my initial payment had gone trough properly.   They said ( which seems lies ) : -The credit was approved validating the SS # and my ID # ONLY. No address was required so the credit bureau apparently approved it WITH THE WRONG ADDRESS or no address at all ( I doubt it ) -Because the billing address was wrong, the payment with my debit card was rejected : Lie. their system stated \\\" successful \\'\\', and my bank has no register of denied transactions attempted to my card number.   So to summarize it : They went through at least XXXX steps to ENSURE I pay fees, and EVERY step I took to prevent to be abused ( I knew credit card companies change address, miss to send letters, and other tricks to create late fees ) was unsuccessful.  \"\n",

This was an error that has been fixed with the updated information send to the XXXX credit bureaus by XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2016. I was told it may take XXXX 45 days to show on my credit history. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I checked my credit history and XXXX was the only one that made the change, while Transunion and XXXX have not made the change yet. I contacted XXXX credit bureaus and I was told to send the letter I had from XXXX XXXX stating dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 that stated the following \\\" ... we have submitted a credit correction request to reflect the above referenced mortgage account as current ; paid as agreed for XXXX 2016. \\'\\' I uploaded this letter to XXXX indicating what had happened and to please correct the information for XXXX 2016 for this creditor, XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2016. I send an overnight package to Transunion with a copy of the letter on XXXX XXXX, 2016 through the USPS. I received a letter from Transunion dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 and no changes were made for this creditor. No explanation why they refuse to rectify my account for XXXX 2016. I called them and after an hour on the phone, they were unable to make any changes and all they can say was to wait another 30 days ( although as of today it has been 45 days ). I called XXXX who has not responded to my dispute yet and has not fixed the problem either and they too are claiming to wait another XXXX 45 days. I do n\\'t understand. I called the creditor, XXXX and they indicated that they have send the report on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and another on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and a follow up on XXXX XXXX. I have urged them to please fix this because is preventing me from buying a new house and since no bank will touch me because it shows a 30 day late notice with XXXX XXXX, I can not get a mortgage loan for 2 years. This is crazy since it was a mistake that has been rectified by the bank, XXXX XXXX, yet the XXXX remaining credit bureaus, Transunion and XXXX refuse to make this correction. Why are they not held accountable for fixing this? I need to know what do I have to do to expedite this process. Please HELP!  \"\n",

Moreover, said account was appearing XXXX on my consumer credit profile notwithstanding the allegation of a single debt owed.   ARC MANAGEMENT GROUP failed to investigate, verify, or validate said debt. Although I also filed a cease and desist demand with ARC MANAGEMENT GROUP an absolute requirement of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is to report said debt as disputed pending resolution of an investigation. ARC MANAGEMENT GROUP failed to report said debt as disputed and failed to conduct an investigation into my allegations of potential fraud. As such, my credit worthiness has been negatively impacted by the erroneous reporting of this account.   A review of records compiled by the state XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Florida indicates that ARC MANAGEMENT GROUP is not currently licensed to conduct business pursuant to section XXXX, Florida statute. As such, the imposition of this debt and the erroneous reporting to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX is an unfair and deceptive trade practice.   Several phone calls to ARC MANAGEMENT GROUP have met upon deaf ears. When I called to inquire on the status of the disputed account, I was advised that Florida licensing was not required. I was further advised that the debt remained due notwithstanding a lack of validation and claim of potential fraud. At this point the call was terminated. My written dispute remains outstanding. Said account remains on my XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX notwithstanding the existence of a dispute, lack of validation, and my allegations of potential fraud.

I have called them regularly but every time I ask about this issue I am given the run around. Below is my account of the situation and I hope you will help me resolve this matter.   On XXXX I used my Serve Prepaid cards to purchase airline tickets for myself and my family for an XXXX trip. The trip was planned for XX/XX/XXXX but we later decided that XXXX would be a better destination and so we cancelled out tickets as they were refundable. Of all the tickets, my refund in the amount of {$2500.00} did not process properly ( this was Airline \\'s error ) and had to be reprocessed in XX/XX/XXXX. This time the refund was properly back to my Serve prepaid card but for some reason the Serve Prepaid system flagged the refund as suspicious and/or against their terms and conditions. Within a matter of 48 hours my wife \\'s and my Serve prepaid accounts along with the several authorized user cards were closed. I also received an email stating that the refund for the airline ticket was denied and sent back to to the Airline.   When I called Serve, I explained that the originalrefund was in fact legitimate and originated from a transaction several months prior. I also explained that I had no issues with the refunds from other family member \\'s and this should not have happened to my account. The representative looked through my past statements dating back to XX/XX/XXXX and found the original transaction pretty easily. She then referred the issue to another department for inquiry and resolution. I would be hearing back from them soon. As of today our accounts remained closed and the balances which were in them ( over {$3000.00} ) has not been refunded. When I call to inquire about our funds or try to get access to account information, past statements and the like I am stonewalled and told none of this information is available. I have no online access to our transactions whatsoever.   In addition to the $ XXXX that Serve has confiscated, the Finance department of the airline has no record that the XXXX refund was returned to them at all. They say they would easily see this if it was the case.  \"\n",

They never respond to my letters, they just renew dates on the credit bureau reports.  \"\n",

I spoke to XXXX about this transaction. The number on my statement is XXXX.  This morning I tried to call XXXX and no numbers work so obviously, I believe I have been scammed.  I called XXXX this morning to ask her the name of her firm. She said XXXX Law. I asked if she could tell me the court the summons was filed in. She could not. I asked her who the process server is, she could not tell me. Her ext. Is XXXX.  She asked for my email and said she would look into it. I gave her an email I do n\\'t use.

Bank of America is XXXX of them. they come up with plan mentioning that you are eligible for physicIan loan with 3.75 % apr AND You do not need to set up any escrow account for it. I asked their agent-XXXX XXXX multiple times that are you sure that I do not have to set up escrow account? She answered me that I am 1000 percentage sure you do not have to set up escrow account with 10 percentage down. There are few lenders who were providing me similar rate with XXXX loan with no set up of escrow account. XXXX was so aggressive that we will give you best service and everytime my question was similar that are you sure that I do n\\'t have to set up escrow and she is saying that I am very sure. We decided to go with Bank of America looking at her confidence and promise. She sent me closing cost work sheet/good faith estimate without any escrow account as well. I can show to prove her promise. meanwhile, I provided lot of documents for my loans in timely manner whatever processor and underwriter was requesting. There was only 4 working business days remain for closing and she came up on XXXX/XXXX/2015 late afternoon mentioning that we have to now set up escrow account. I made mistake and please forgive me. I was really upset because not setting up escrow account was only reason to go with bank of America. There are other lender providing same rate loan with out escrow. I was really anxious because only 1 wk remained for my closing. I felt cheated as customer by end of day. I can not understand that loan went through different stages before final approval and nobody noticed or informed me about escrow thing until last moment when only 4 days remained so I can not go any where. I would never go with Bank of America if I am aware about that I had to set up escrow. I had different options for not setting up escrow for home loan. I ended up paying additional XXXX for escrow account and now monthly payment that I was not ready for it. I would totally consider it as a fraud and cheating to customer. I believe that it is customer right to get correct information about product whenever they are buying something. INFORM CUSTOMER ABOUT SURPRISE WHEN THEY CAN NOT DO ANYTHING THAT IS MOTTO OF BANK OF AMERICA.   please help me out with this matter so no one else can get fooled/cheated by them.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"I am wondering if you can assist me with filing a formal complaint regarding the servicer of my current XXXX loan that is serviced through Seneca Mortgage Servicing.  I have been actively trying to get them to provide me with their Assumption requirements for my loan since XXXX/XXXX/15. They originally refused to acknowledge my loan is eligible for an Assumption, even though all of my origination documentation states it is eligible for an assumption. They then had stated they do not have an actual assumption process in place to support eligibility requirements that my mortgage qualifies for. Not having an assumption process in place as a servicer is also not aligned to FHFA servicing requirements, or those outlined under the CFPB requirements. They advised since they do not have a formal process, my only option is to refinance my loan, which is unfair, and deceptive practices in my opinion. They want to push my into a refi process to potentially charge me additional points, fees etc, which I am not the least interested in and have advised them accordingly a few times. They then sent me a letter for loss mitigation options, which I am also not interested in what so ever, as I am current, have always been current, and I do not have a financial hardship. As I have tried escalating this issues as a formal complaint with them, they also do not have a complaint process in place, no acknowledgement of my complaint, and no follow up with me on the issue. I am not sure if they as a smaller servicer, are also held to the same standards to manage a complaint process as set forth with requirements under the O.C.C., National Servicing Standards, CFPB requirements or by FHFA. The only time they respond to me is if I initiate another email to them online. I have let them know they had until last Friday, XXXX to contact me with an acceptable solution based on what my loan is eligible for based on my origination documents, which is well over 30 days from when I contacted them, followed up XXXX different times to work through the issue. I advised if they have not contacted me, like they have not been, my only other option is to escalate this issue to FHFA, you FHLMC, the CFPB, the O.C.C. and my state AG. They have not upheld requirements for all of these agencies to support an assumption process, have used unfair/deceptive practices to push me to products I do n\\'t want/need, all due to their inability to service my loans to the eligibility/standards outlined in my origination documents I signed.  Anything you can do to assist is appreciated. This is also all also documented in their online email site as well.  \"\n",

Why do I, as a Bank of America customer have to spent my time addressing the same issue month after month. You, as Bank of America employees get paid for your time.

XXXX has gone into my bank account and taken payments on a balance that I owed them from the original loan of XXXX. XXXX even sent a letter to me stating that I only owed them XXXX and if I were to bring that payment in to them that I would be eligible to re-loan with the company.  When I questioned the representative from Location Services about the balance his reply was \\\" I dont know either \\'\\' and he hung up the phone on me after I explained to him that I dont owe that much from XXXX and that they received payments directly from my checking account.

I never had a loan with XXXX XXXX. I \\'m not sure why this is even listed. There \\'s no information showing on my XXXX credit report. On my Transunion credit report it shows the account as being open, with a 90 day past due status. If a creditor saw this they would think the account is still open. There is a lot of inaccurate information on my credit reports. Also, prior to me paying off this debt with XXXX I sent a certified letter to XXXX XXXX as that was listed on my credit reports ( I found out they handle lots of accounts including XXXX, again I signed a contract with XXXX, not XXXX XXXX ) wishing to settle this debt in return for possibly deletion of the negative information from my credit reports. I never got a written response from this company, so I called them, they stated they do not settle accounts and I ask if I would get something in writing and they said \\\" No \\'\\' .So I contacted XXXX directly and just paid the debt. This is why I \\'m contacting the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection so I can be assured that I will get a response and update to my credit reporting issue.  \"\n",

Sometime around XXXX of 2014 I continued going back and forth with XXXX regarding XXXX of my XXXX loan payments that had never appeared to be credited to my account. XXXX continue to acknowledge and send me multitutude of apologies and promises to take care of the situation. In the mist of being behind XXXX sent me XXXX applications to apply for another modification. After being hounded, I applied and received only a letter stating they rec \\'d my information and would contact me. All of this was still \\\" under investigation \\'\\' and \\\" being worked on \\'\\' by XXXX when they sent my loan over to Green Tree. XXXX continuously sent me letters with the same content over and over promising they were tending to my issue. I have included XXXX but have plenty more of the same. I sent the last XXXX which was in XXXX, about XXXX weeks before they told me they were selling my loan. I supplied these letters and a few others to Green Tree.   Then Green Tree, even after being told that this was going on, sent the letters XXXX sent me, and I also exercised the FDCPA requesting correction to the amount owed sent in the original notice, they completely ignored the information and sent me Default Notices. They even sent me a notice stating that I was behind my XXXX payment in XXXX? I received a notice to apply for modification, even though XXXX has my application and documents, nothing has been done about the misapplied payment, and in XXXX I made a payment to XXXX prior to my account going to Green Tree that I \\'ve been told is \\\" awaiting processing \\'\\' but continuously receiving letters stating they do n\\'t have it and send documentation that they are holding the payment ( which I did -record straight from XXXX ). I continue to send my payments and request communication via email or written documentation ( XXXX ). They tell me they are a debt collector, but completely ignore my side of being able to exercise my FDCPA rights? today I received a letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 basically telling me they are preparing to take my home and that they have n\\'t received a response from me ( they have gotten many and I have tracking and fax confirmations ).  I show that I owe for XXXX, XXXX \\'s payment was sent in. They are telling me I owe for XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX- ( they have n\\'t received the XXXX payment since it was just mailed, so I assume it would be XXXX ( which they have ) and XXXX which is a payment that carries on in dispute-not XXXX, but the payment XXXX was supposed to credit my account with.   This has been absolutely horrible. Not to mention their calls and XXXX which an extremely rude person told me that it did n\\'t matter XXXX I tried to explain talking loudly only confuses me. They were still yelling when I hung up the phone.   I just do n\\'t think it \\'s fair how XXXX can just ignore their promises and what should have been communicated and Green Tree ignore dealing with it and telling me I \\'m not responding.   Thank you for any assistance, I am incredibly stressed over this and feel bad that they think XXXX I \\'m dumb.  \"\n",

Consequently, I notified the lender via Rescission.   UNLAWFUL APPRAISAL WHICH INFLATED ACTUAL VALUE OF PROPERTY2. Originator inflated the value of my home by stating non existent equipment on appraisal, e.g. falsely alleging a jacuzzi tub when in actuality I never owned a jacuzzi tub ; falsely stating granite upgrades to my home which is inaccurate.  3. XXXX denied me a choice in appraiser and insisted on their appraiser which inflated the value of my property. Consequently, closing was delayed 3 weeks, and caused my loan rate to increase.   UNLAWFUL KICKBACK ( S ) 4. The mortgage broker from XXXX XXXX who arranged for my loan stated that {$10000.00} additional kickbacks were paid in addition to initially disclosed stated points and fees. Further, closing statement reflects that XXXX XXXX received an additional {$90000.00} in fees in addition to normal loan origination fees. I did not consent to these fees.   IMPROPER, FRAUDULENT CHAIN OF TITLE5. Subsequently, Around XX/XX/XXXX, My ex transferred title to me, XXXX XXXX XXXX, the legal owner of record. The lender \\'s chain of title is broken by way of an assignment of Deed of Trust from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, which obviously omits transfer from XXXX XXXX to XXXX. Further, the executor of this document, XXXX XXXX as assistant secretary of XXXX, is a known robosigner as evidenced by online research.   UNLAWFUL SECURITIZATION6. Upon closing in XXXX, loan was immediately securitized by XXXX XXXX to XXXX without my authorization, contrary to the stipulations in the loan documents.   MORTGAGE BROKER CONVICTED7. Around XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX was convicted of fraud and lost their license in XXXX which reciprocated loss of license in XXXX. Further scrutiny by the XXXX Attorney General caused subsequent closure and bankruptcy of XXXX in XXXX at time of loan funding.   WILFUL REFUSAL OF LENDER TO PROVIDE ME THE DOCUMENTS I REQUESTED8. During XXXX on a monthly basis I phoned XXXX to request copies of their loan, note, and closing documents on file. Customer service repeatedly failed and refused my lawful request, alleging such documents did not exist or could not be located. Therefore, XXXX did not have any lawful authority to service my loan.   LENDER FRAUDULENTLY INDUCED ME TO DEFAULT11. When I requested a loan modification from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the subsequent assignee from XXXX XXXX ), I was repeatedly told each month I would not qualify until I was at least XXXX days \\\" into foreclosure \\'\\'. I continually requested a loan modification for XXXX but was denied the opportunity as a XXXX individual to even apply. Their tactic caused me great XXXX because I had been current on my mortgage up at the time of my request ( s ).   LENDER HAS NO LAWFUL AUTHORITY TO INITIATE TRUSTEE SALE12. The trustee sale documents are unlawful and contain numerous defects including the lack of proper, verifiable signature ; nor was I served properly.   XXXX : XXXX : XXXX/  \"\n",

I asked them to send me something in writing regarding the debt they claim I owe.  After several requests I did finally get a vague letter on XXXX XXXX.  I immediately drafted a responce to the letter to Cease and Desist and that I have no record of said debt and if they had futher documentation to please mail it to me.  I did not hear anything from them for a few days and then they called and left a message indicating they were going to service me XXXX days later. I emailed a repsone to the same emailed letter indicating I have certified my dispute letter to them. I had not heard anything from them since my email on XXXX XXXX until today.  So far today they have called me at work XXXX times. The woman was very rude and nasty and told me I have XXXX warrants for my arrest for charges. When I asked what this is regarding she began screaming in the phone I told her to stop calling me and if they feel I owe money to please mail me proof to the XXXX XXXX provided them. They then proceeded to call my cell phone XXXX times in a row.  They have now also called a co-worker and told that personI have XXXX warrants out for my arrest and they will be picking me up if I do not call them and resolve the debt today.  This is absurd and is way out of hand.  I always pay my bills on time if not early. I have no records of the debt they are claiming I owe and have simply requested proof and for them to stop calling my work and cell phone.  Please help  \"\n",

Using the common definition of an \\\" open account \\'\\' as one not being closed and active, or the legal, banking definition of an \\\" open account \\'\\', a revolving account, such as a loan/credit card, this agency is communicating to me false, deceptive, and misleading information.   Under the FDCPA, reporting to the credit bureaus is a communication to me, the consumer.   XXXX v. XXXX XXXX , XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX.

Along with having no \\\" open account \\'\\' with either bank, nor have I ever made the alleged payment which PCM is illegally reporting and communicating to me via my credit reports.   This agency has been reporting against me for over two years, and has refused to remove their illegal reporting. I recently filed a complaint with your agency, because I owe no money to the bank which PCM alleges.   PCM only respond with their own internal document that stated nothing more than I owe what they claim, yet provided no actual independent admissible, in a court of law, proof.   The did not state the name of the party verifying the information.   This agency is a repeat violator of the FDCPA against me, and even paid a settlement to me two years ago, for their violations against me.   They claimed I owed another debt which I clearly did not owe.   They could provide no proof of the debt, and even illegally disclosed to a third party that another party owed a debt.   Myself and this other party were forced to retain counsel ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). It was only after an attorney forced them to comply with the law, did they finally comply with the law.   Currently, they have violated the FCRA and FDCPA for over two years against me, with its current illegal reporting.   I respectfully ask that your agency demand that PCM provide to you proof of the alleged payment made on this alleged account on the date PCM claims I made such payment.   PCM \\'s conduct, as it did two years ago against me, violates the FDCPA, FCRA, the Arkansas Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.   Their conduct is also perilously close to civil RICO violations, as they have been put on notice numerous times their conduct is illegal, yet they continue to target me.   I can only assume it \\'s in retaliation for bringing them to justice the last time they violated the law against me.   A literally false statement violates the FDCPA as a matter of law. See, XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ).   PCM \\'s statements on my credit reports are false, and this violates the law. PCM \\'s disagreement with the law does not trump the law.   This is a repeat FDCPA violator, and if they dispute this, I can provide your agency with proof of their prior violations and proof they were forced to pay FDCPA damages.   In approx. two weeks I am filing a private action against PCM and XXXX XXXX, which I will forward to you also.   I can also provide to you contact information of others PCM was forced to pay FDCPA settlements for clear violations of the Act.  \"\n",

I am facing a hiring fraud and credit card fraud because Wells Fargo allows their accounts to reverse payments weeks after payment was received and spent again. I was paid through XXXX Wells Fargo accounts and the funds were put into my credit cards, but they were taken away again ... leaving me with a massive debt. I went to the local Wells Fargo branch to see what could be done, but they would n\\'t help because the I was not permitted to see the XXXX accounts.   I was scammed by XXXX XXXX XXXX if that is her name XXXX and XXXX Systems XXXX if that is truly the company name. I was told that I was hired as a buyer, but for the first few weeks I had to use my credit line to make purchases ... supposedly until the corporate credit card was ready for me. Payments were made to me in advance by following this procedure:1 ) Take a credit card with a balance and pay that off with XXXX funds.  2 ) Ring up new charges on that card for XXXX purchases to the amount XXXX provided.  3 ) Repeat 1 and 2.   Needless to say, the job was n\\'t real. The paycheck and benefits package never came. The payments to my credit cards were recalled with stop payment orders, so that the payments I had made were canceled. My XXXX card alone could cost me {$50000.00} in XXXX purchases.   Wells Fargo enabled this kind of fraud by allowing the payments to be reversed long after they were approved. This gave the scammers a few weeks to build up my confidence, and then to hit me hard with massive reversals, all the while taking the value of the purchases I had made for them. The XXXX XXXX accounts at Wells Fargo must be showing frequent payments and reversals, and the way banks monitor their accounts these days, they must have known that this was unusual behavior, possibly criminal.   I need to be protected as an innocent victim from this massive fraud. I also need to know that this can not be done again. Please tell me what can be done.  \"\n",

There was an offer for monthly services which would cost $ XXXX/month, I did not select this serivce. On XXXX XXXX, my account was debited by Experian for {$29.00}. I called to inquire and was directed to Credit Check Total requesting that my account be refunded for the {$29.00} as I did NOT authorize any deductions nor did I agree to any memberships. I spoke with XXXX associates and XXXX supervisors and was told that they would cancel my \\'membership \\' but they would not be able to refund my money. Even after expressing my frustration and my concern regarding their tactics, which I feel are manipulative and evasive ; no one would honor my request to have my money refunded. I also sent an email to the customer relations departments for both Credit Check Total and Experian. Credit Check Total \\'s response was that they could not refund the money that was taken but that my account was now closed.  This company does not care that a consumer feels misled by their advertisment, all they care about is collecting {$29.00} from as many people as they caan. I am very upset over this and from now reading reviews from other victims, it is clear that this company is strong-arming consumers and taking our money. Credit Check Total is a poor representation and their only goal is to profit from comsumers using manipulative tactics.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"Dear CFPB, This complaint is regarding a former and resolved complaint, case # XXXX, regarding Wells Fargo account # XXXX. A brief history of the original complaint is necessary to set forth this complaint : I received private undergraduate student loans through Wells Fargo. After, I consolidated my loans. When the loans were consolidated, I was a nave XXXX year old, and, as most loan contracts or loan consolidation contracts are, this one was gigantic and complicated. Since having gone to law school, I now understand I would have no qualm about arguing the contract is defective for any number of reasons, e.g., adhesion, unconscionable, etc. Upon arriving at law school, I asked that Wells Fargo defer my loans. To this point, I had no idea the consolidation preempted my ability to consolidate in the future. However, I was informed that it had. The payments were over {$280.00} per month. The payments crushed me through school to the point that at the end of every semester I was unable to make this payment, or other payments. At the end of every semester I would call, and ask that the loans be put into forbearance. Every time Wells Fargo responded the loans could not be put into forbearance during school and that I would be charged late fees.   After nearly three years of XXXX school, and on the day after XXXX of XXXX, I called Wells Fargo to tell them I would not be able to make another payment, and they could call and leave as many messages as they wanted ( that a customer service rep wanted to talk about my account ), but I still would not be able to pay. Again, I asked for forbearance. Then, I drafted my first complaint to CFPB. Within days, Wells Fargo \\'s \\\" policy had changed, \\'\\' and my loan was magically put into forbearance. If the policy did in fact change the day after CFPB notified Wells Fargo of my complaint, then I have no problem. This is doubtful. There are only two options. The first : Wells Fargo did not want to deal with my complaint, paid me {$56.00} for XXXX late fee, and put the loan into forbearance. That is good and well, except in that first scenario Wells Fargo lied in its letter about the forbearance. Second : At some point the Wells Fargo policy did actually change, my loan could have gone into forbearance, and every single time I called they missed it. I believe either scenario is deceptive. Please let me know if your agency can aid in this matter.   If not, misleading statements that violate state law, XXXX. XXXX XXXX. XXXX, are not preempted by the Comptroller \\'s jurisdiction. See XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo Bank , NA, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX Cir. XXXX ). Because I believe either scenario to be misleading, I would be willing to explore filing a state action should your agency not be able to help in the matter for whatever reason.  \"\n",

I typically send additional principal payment along with the mortgage amount that is due each month.  Mortgage payments can be paid within the XXXX through the XXXX of the month. I use to pay early before XXXX but PHH did n\\'t apply the funds and in fact frequently called me to tell me the mortgage was \\\" late \\'\\' because they refused to apply the early funds before XXXX the month. THey did this even though the money was sitting in the account but they simply did n\\'t apply it.  To avoid that I pay after XXXX the month before XXXX.  My payments are sent through my bank \\'s bill pay system and the bank record indicates that the money was taken out of the account on XXXX XXXX and posted to the PHH mortgage account, XX/XX/XXXX.The excess payment towards principal was never applied. In fact when I received the statement for the following month the excess amountof {$490.00} was in a \\\" Suspense Balance \\'\\' and was not applied towards principal.  It was listed as \\\" Partial Payment ( Unapplied ) \\'\\'. I contacted XXXX XXXX the PHH representative and she claimed that the payment was applied the following day because the statement was printed before the application of these funds.  XXXX statement does n\\'t make sense since the statement clearly shows that the mortgage payment posted on XXXX so why was the extra principal payment not included since all the moneys were sent at the same time? why would an extra payment be applied on a different date than the mortgage payment? Again, it was all sent as a single payment.Lastly, the new statements are issued after the XXXX not early in the month so this is patently false.  Although XXXX promised to send evidence that the payment was applied, I have received no such evidence. I am very concerned that the extra payments are not being applied AT ALL and simply pocketed by PHH.  XXXX stated I would be receiving a record of my mortgage payments for this year.  I have had issues with PHH in the past, such as having a fully paid off HELOC line stay as an outstanding lien on my property for years because XXXX did n\\'t record it as a satisfied mortgage.  \"\n",

When the bank notified me of my mistake I went back to the urgent care clinic and wrote them another check. I later learned that TeleChek was refusing to authorize my check and was told to contact them. When I told them what happened they demanded {$30.00} before they would authorize any more checks and also collected ( again ) the fee for the urgent care center, which I had already paid to the urgent care center. I tried to explain but was told either I pay or I can never cash another check again. When I asked for a supervisor I was told non available. I wrote telecheck and complained, asked what government agency was responsible for them and they told me the wrong agency. I finally found out the right agency, wrote to them, no answer. I feel like I have been blackmailed. I never contracted with Telechek. They are not my bank. I do n\\'t understand what right they have to fine me for making a mistake except that they have the power to deny me ever being able to cash another check. Thanks for listening.  \"\n",

I was told my card had a limit of {$1500.00}. I was not told anything else and I did not use this card ever again. I was never told there was any promotion tied to the account. When I logged into pay my bill, I noticed that last month my balance went from approximately {$500.00} to over {$1000.00}. This was solely due to a deferred interest charge and attendant finance charges.   No one from Best Buy ever told me that I was accruing interest or that I needed to pay-off my balance in full by XX/XX/XXXX. If they had, I would have done so. When I called to complain, a Best Buy representative told me this was a common complaint, particularly for customers who were enrolled in paperless statements and he understood why I was misled. He attempted to override the imposition of the interest charges but was unable to do so because of Best Buy corporate policy ( according to this representative ).   I find it extremely deceptive and abusive to provide no disclosures about the terms of a credit card during holiday shopping season and then, nearly two full years later, apply a 100 % increase to my balance through a deferred finance charge. Had I been told I needed to pay-off my balance in full, I would have done so immediately and avoided this {$500.00} charge.  \"\n",

Moreover, due to this phantom missed payment, they have been charging me for the certified letters and also adding in fees marked \\\" other \\'\\' on a monthly basis ; I do n\\'t not have any idea why or what these fees are. I have every statement available starting from XXXX 2013 ( this is as far back as Ocwen \\'s payment system goes ) and have not missed one payment. In fact, I am generally a couple of weeks early with my payment and always send extra. We sent a letter with all of our statements to Ocwen stating that we have not missed a payment and to please correct their error. They continued with their stance that we are a payment behind but can not show us proof of a missed payment. I called and spoke to them over the phone to find out when exactly did I miss a payment and their response was \\\" I do n\\'t know, you tell me \\'\\'. Based on what I can see, somehow they made a mistake and are posting my payments that are a couple of weeks early to the previous month and saying it is a couple of weeks late. Complicating the matter is that they do not provide any statements or payment books. I \\'ve wasted countless hours on the phone with them and they have repeatedly told me to disregard the certified letter, yet my account is being listed in default. I \\'ve read numerous complaints online about this mortgage company and truly feel like they are trying to take advantage of me and lots of other people for that matter. It \\'s \\\" XXXX vs. XXXX \\'\\' and without help, I am going to be forced to make an extra payment that does not exist because I ca n\\'t fight a mortgage giant on my own.  \"\n",

As soon as it was able to be fixed, I again reached out to let them know the mistake they were making. They said they would call me back.   What they have done, is nothing, and have over charged me for a payment that was never late, and should have never been late. And to this date, there has been no issue resolved.  \"\n",

A few months after closing on the home, my mortgage was sold to another lender ( as I was informed it would be ). My mortgage was purchased by U.S. Bank with the first payment to be made to them on XXXX XXXX, 2015, however, upon receipt of my first bill in XXXX, I noticed that the monthly payment amount was incorrect ( approximately $ 200/month higher than it should have been ). I immediately figured out that this mistake was based on the fact that the terms of my XXXX-XXXX-buy down ( clearly stated in my mortgage documents ) were not being accounted for. My first call to the customer service line to resolve this issue was met with, \\\" I \\'m sorry ma\\'am, that \\'s just what your payment is now, there \\'s nothing we can do about it. \\'\\' After I refused to accept this as an answer I was then transferred ( without my knowledge ) to the collections department. At this point, I was not late on any payments and the collections department was of no help to me. By the time I got off of that call, it was too late in the day to call back. Upon my second call to the customer service line, I was not given any answers, but told the issue I was describing would be \\\" looked into \\'\\' and an inquiry request was submitted. About two, to two and a half weeks later I received a notice in the mail informing me that the incorrect payment I was calling about was, in fact, correct. I immediately called back, and because at this point my payment was late, I was directed to the collections department ... again. During this conversation, after expressing my frustration, I was finally able to obtain a fax number to which I could send the SIGNED mortgage documents stating what the correct payment should be ( attached ). These documents were submitted to U.S. Bank on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and confirmation of receipt was given when I called U.S. Bank later that day. In the weeks following XX/XX/XXXX, I received no resolution of the issue, and instead received countless calls, and letters in the mail informing me that I was late on my mortgage payments and my account was in default. As of XXXX/XXXX/2015, there is still no resolution and I have begun receiving letters stating that my account will be moved into foreclosure and I could lose my home unless I take action. This notification is deeply disturbing as I have only wanted to PAY my mortgage and continue owning my first home. I even signed up for Auto-Pay XX/XX/XXXX with the belief that the issue would be resolved in time for my next payment ( on XXXX/XXXX/2015 ). Unfortunately, there has been no effort to resolve this issue in a timely manner and for the past two and a half months I have been left feeling stressed, nervous and confused about what is happening, or going to happen, to my home. No one should ever have to make 15+ calls to a bank explaining how to read mortgage documents. No one should have to worry that after signing a contract to purchase their XXXX home, that the terms of that contract might not be honored a few months later when the mortgage is sold. The fact that I have wasted countless hours of my time, both during work hours and after, over the past two months to correct someone else \\'s mistake is beyond comprehension. This would n\\'t stand in my line of work, and it should n\\'t stand in the financial industry. Consumers should be given more support/answers when submitting a complaint as substantial as a complete-misreading-of-a-contract.  \"\n",

XX/XX/XXXX, I made the decision to take the fall semester off. Simultaneously, my Chase student loan was charged off after they said I failed to contact them, even though I was in in-school deferment. My efforts with Chase to reestablish the loan under the original terms were dismissed. As a result, I was forced to enter a payment plan to pay-off the remaining principal of my loan or the action would result in charge off on my credit report, which would substantially affect my chances of bar admission. From XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, I made 3 payments in the amount of {$820.00}. I reenrolled in law school XX/XX/XXXX, and I am currently enrolled full-time. I am unable to make the remaining 3 payments, which I believe I should not have had to make in the first place. I would like to speak with an individual at the CFPB to determine my options, since this very well could affect my bar admission.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"In XXXX 2015 I went to Wells Fargo Bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, VA, XXXX XXXX ). I deposited my payroll check as usual. It was not until I went to a local store to make a purchase that I was told my debit card was declined. I called the customer service line for Wells Fargo to inquire about the issue and was told it would take 3-5 business days to resolve and was told my funds were deposited and withdrawn on the same day. It is important to note that I did not make a withdraw request only a deposit. This was on a Saturday which left me without any money until the next week. Well on XXXX/XXXX/15 I again went to the same Wells Fargo bank to deposit my payroll check and again the transaction made by teller was that of a deposit and withdraw again leaving me without access to my money. I am not sure why this continues to happen. I have called the customer department and spoke with XXXX XXXX but again was told it would take 3-5 business days to research problem. I also spoke with XXXX Customer Service Manager and was told she could not speak to me over the phone due to confidentiality, and suggested I come into the branch. This is not acceptable to me as I would need to take time off work which would cause hardship. I feel like I have no other recourse than to file a complaint. I have been a loyal customer for over 20 years.   Please advise,  \"\n",

       "         value: \"When I was shopping at Kohl \\'s on XXXX XXXX, 2015, the salesclerk convinced me to apply for a Kohl \\'s charge card by promising that I would get 30 % off of my purchase. However, instead of the application being accepted, a receipt printed that said : \\\" We are unable to complete processing of your application at this time. \\'\\' The clerk said that this meant that my application was declined. He could no longer provide me with the 30 % off. Additionally, he took back the written terms and conditions for the credit card. I questioned him if the application was in fact denied, since that was not what the receipt said. He said that the application was denied and that \\'s what that message meant.  On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I called the Kohl \\'s Charge Account customer service number at XXXX. I spoke with XXXX, who then transferred me to XXXX. I wanted to confirm that the application was in fact denied and was not being processed. XXXX stated that my application was denied and I would be receiving a letter within 30 days explaining why it was denied.  Since I did not receive the promised discount and was not able to keep a copy of the terms and conditions - and therefore was not able to read the terms and conditions - I wanted to make sure that the card was not processed. I fully understood that there would be a credit pull on my credit report ; however, if the application was still being processed and was not declined, I did not want a trade line reported or something showing that I closed the account, since this will negatively affect my credit.  Imagine my surprise when, instead of receiving a letter stating why my application was denied, I received a credit card in the mail. So, on XXXX XXXX, 2015, I wrote to Kohl \\'s Credit Customer Service. I asked for a refund of the amount I should have saved if I had received the promised 30 % discount. I also asked for Kohl \\'s to mail me a copy of the credit card \\'s terms and conditions and train its employees to provide accurate information.  I received a letter from Kohl \\'s dated XXXX XXXX, 2015. Enclosed was a copy of the Cardmember Agreement. However, Kohl \\'s declined to provide me with the promised discount because I did not make any purchases on a Kohl \\'s Credit Card - which I could n\\'t do, because at the time of purchase, the application was still being process. However, Kohl \\'s offered a courtesy credit on a future purchase. This offer was not clear, so on XXXX XXXX, 2015, I sent an email to the address provided by Kohl \\'s to clarify the courtesy offer.  Kohl \\'s responded that it could n\\'t assist me by email so I called the customer service number on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I spoke with XXXX. She informed me that Kohl \\'s would provide me with a 30 % discount if I made a purchase with my Kohl \\'s card and then submitted a claim for a credit to my account. But, I could not combine the 30 % discount with any other discounts being offered at the store. So, for example, if the store was offering a 20 % discount, I would need to skip the 20 % discount and not use any coupons in order to receive the 30 % discount from the Kohl \\'s card. Or, I could go on one of the days when the store was not offering any discounts - XXXX checked and there were only XXXX such days in the entire month.  Since I was not being offered the promised benefit that induced me to sign up for the card, I asked Kohl \\'s to cancel the card. Since Kohl \\'s refused to honor its promotion and I never activated or used the credit card, I asked Kohl \\'s to request that the consumer reporting agencies XXXX CRAs ) suppress the trade line. XXXX said that she could n\\'t do that but that I could send a formal request in writing. My credit history should not be adversely affected by a company that does not honor its promises and does not adequately train its staff to correctly answer inquiries.  \"\n",

They said they are going through with the sheriff sale on XXXX/XXXX/15. This is only 20 days away - we have a farm with horses, cats, etc.!!! This is not fair. They told us they would review our file and get back to us. We have not been treated fairly.  This is lender abuse. I am XXXX - please investigate.

She said to send it by XXXX/XXXX/15.  We submitted all documents in a timely manner on XXXX/XXXX/15. On XXXX/XXXX/15 we received a letter from XXXX XXXX stating that they are reviewing the documentation we sent to them. On XXXX/XXXX/15, we received a letter from XXXX saying that the required information was not yet received (? ), even though they got it and said this in her XXXX/XXXX/15 letter. In addition, the letter on the XXXX did not state what information was still needed.  On XXXX/XXXX/15 we received another letter from XXXX telling us the sheriff sale would be postponed until XXXX/XXXX/15. We received another letter on XXXX/XXXX/15 stating that XXXX was still reviewing the information ( XXXX ext. XXXX ).  Then we received XXXX phone calls and letters stating they were reviewing everything.  Yesterday, out of the blue, we received a phone call from someone else stating they would not do anything because our mortgage was over {$700000.00} and we are going to sheriff sale in 20 days!!!! How can they do this? Our loan has been {$900000.00} from day one!!!! Please help. This is unfair banking practice!!!!  \"\n",

Around XXXX/XXXX/15 I mailed Capital One 360 the required form for a Trustee to Trustee transfer of the funds from a IRA CD with Capital One Bank that was maturing on XXXX/XXXX/15.   On XXXX/XXXX/15 I called Capital One 360 to verify their receipt of the transfer form. They verified having received the transfer form and informed me it was signed, approved, and mailed to Capital One on XXXX/XXXX/15.   On XXXX/XXXX/15 I called Capital One to see if they received the paper work from Capital One 360.  I was informed they did not receive it and that the transfer form should have been mailed to Capital One not Capital One 360. I argued with the Representative that what she was telling me was incorrect and the form must be sent to Capital One 360 and they must sign it and then forward it to Capital One.  She insisted that I mail a copy to Capital One which I did.   In addition, on XXXX/XXXX/15, I called Capital One 360 and asked if they could fax the form to Capital One and they refused.   On XXXX/XXXX/15 I received a message from Capital One to return their call.   I called Capital One on XXXX/XXXX/15 and they inform me that could not accept the form I just mailed them because it was not signed and approved by CAPITAL ONE 360. which is what I tried to explain to the Capital One Representative on XXXX/XXXX/15.   At this point I requested to talk to a supervisor at both divisions.   After discussing what had transpired in the past it was agreed that Capital One 360 would fax the original form to Capital One today and confirm it by Email to me. Never received any confirmation.  I would have expected at least XXXX of the supervisors ( XXXX ) would have folllowed up on my problem.    Capital One said they did not receive the form from Capital One 360 because I had the wrong address of Capital One on the form, this is completely FALSE, because I put the address that Capital One gave me and is on all their correspondence XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX. In addition, if it was incorrect Capital One 360 should of corrected it.   At this time I have no idea when I will have access to my money.   Banks should be penalized for not making customers funds available because of their incompetence.   My funds not being available when due has cause me major problems.   I have another CD maturing on XXXX/XXXX/15 and because of the new IRA rules requiring trustee to trustee transfers for IRA rollovers. I would like written instructions from Capital One on how to get my money transfer to another institution on a timely basis.   XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  \"\n",

I have been a card holder with them for over 4 years and have never missed a payment, I always pay on the due date and receive email reminders regarding the account. I simply made an oversight on my bill due XXXX XXXX, 2015. I had gone on their website, as normal on the due date and inadvertently, I did not hit \\\" submit \\'\\' after entering my payment information. I realized I had made an error the following day and promptly scheduled the payment one day past the due date. I asked them via chat and an email to wave the late fee due to my impeccable payment history. They declined both the requests and advised me of email alerts again which I already have set on the account. I feel they are being unfair because I was an authorized user on my spouse \\'s discover credit card account that fell behind and he recently had to file bankruptcy due to an under performing business that he shared ownership in. He is listed on my account as an authorized user as well. I am also a former employee of discover and was given a very low fixed interest rate on the account. I feel this is also a factor as about a year ago they lowered my credit line sighting too many balances close to the credit line which was not the case as most of my other creditors raised my limits around the same time without me even requesting increases. The decrease on the credit line also mysteriously got lowered at the same time my spouse \\'s discover account had fallen a couple payments behind. So I feel that they are using his history and his bankruptcy to treat me unfairly as well. I \\'m quite sure they have treated other former employees the same and are using very deceptive practices. They also do n\\'t follow FDCPA regulations because when my spouse \\'s discover account was in collections they would at times leave more than XXXX message per day on the same phone number which is not in compliance with FDCPA regulations. All I want is a {$25.00} adjustment from a company who makes XXXX of dollars. It is not the monetary value of the late fee that is discerning rather the blatant disregard for a customer of 4 years who has never been late previously. In essence I feel that because of the card act and my low fixed interest rate and their inability to raise the interest rate without just cause, that they are bullying me into voluntarily closing the account as they are not able to make a significant profit off of my credit card account as the operations cost are somewhat equal to the revenue they generate from my account. With ten years experience working in the credit card industry for several of the world \\'s largest credit card issuers the general rule of thumb is that customers are eligible for a courtesy late fee waver once every 12 months for an open account in good standing. They failed to adhere to the rule of thumb in this case. With these unfair practices I find it hard to see how Discover has a reputation for delivering superior customer service with ratings just behind XXXX XXXX. I do n\\'t intend to sit back and let discover bully me as a consumer.  \"\n",

I contacted the MN Attorney General \\'s office XXXX XXXX, XXXX because of grave concerns regarding Reverse Mortgage Solutions ( RMS ), ( subsidiary XXXX XXXX ) business practices and how they use stalling tactics coupled with poorly trained customer service reps who loose paperwork, are rude, tell me I have done something wrong, etc., to keep me from purchasing my family property at 95 % of current market value.  In XXXX, XXXX my mother was coerced into signing a reverse mortgage on a house that had been paid for many years. Mom was thinking this was some how the end to her financial worries, as promised, because like her and so many elderly victims of this kind of abuse, she had more dollar value in property than she had in liquid cash. This mortgage company and others like it prey on the weak and elderly. These companies operate with little to no over-site by state and federal government and steal equity and property from occupants and heirs. If RMS was playing by the rules set forth by HUD XXXX, I would not be writing to your agency.  The FHA case number to the loan is : XXXX. It is my understanding that as her heir, daughter, I am entitled to purchase the property for 95 % of market value as stated in her closing papers from \\\" XXXX XXXX XXXX \\'\\' and the paper work that was delivered to my dead mother \\'s mailbox dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX from RMS. I am a cash buyer so I did not require loan approval or funds.  I have clearly stated to RMS I am interested in purchasing the property several times over.  My mother passed away XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, was buried XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, and Reverse Mortgage Solutions ( RMS ) was notified of her death XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by my sister. She called the RMS the customer service number noted on Mom \\'s monthly statement.  A condolence letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was delivered to my dead mother \\'s mailbox via US mail even though RMS knew she was dead and I was listed as the contact person for my mother \\'s RMS account. Every year, mom had to sign a paper stating she was still living in her house ( occupancy ) and clearly state who to contact if RMS needed to do so. That was my first red flag with this company - many, many more were to come as I continued to deal with RMS.  I called RMS general customer service number only after leaving several messages with XXXX XXXX, my POC who was suppose to guide me through the process. I only talked to XXXX \\'s voice mail, never to her in person. Her VM stated she would return calls within 48 hrs. Well, that NEVER happened!! I have yet to talk to XXXX. Plus, the extension to the telephone number listed on the paperwork never did work!! Any time I attempted to call XXXX, I would go through the customer service number - the same XXXX my sister used.  I was told by RMS customer service to state my intentions of what I want to do with the house. I clearly marked the box that stated the 95 % pay off option ( which was explained to me by RMS that meant current market value ) and Faxed the letter back. I kept the cover sheet from the Fax transaction clearly stating the Fax was indeed sent and received correctly. Additionally, I hired a probate attorney on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to represent the estate through the probate process.  RMS has illegally accelerated foreclosure proceedings on the property. According to HUD guidelines, I had 9 months before that was to begin. RMS has made a complete mess out of this seemingly easy transaction and with no legal oversight by state and federal regulators, RMS continues to conduct business in an injurious manner.

       "         value: \"When I began to transact business with XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received {$5000.00}. To date, I have repaid {$6300.00} : The original {$5000.00} plus {$1300.00} extra. With no official notice to me, XXXX XXXX went out of business in XXXX XXXX yet, I unknowingly continued to pay towards the loan and follow all the rules handed to me by CashCall and XXXX XXXX who acted as debt collectors and continued to harass and collect thousands of dollars for XXXX. After discussing the loan with my tax preparer and embarking on my own investigating, I decided to stop paying XXXX, CashCall, and XXXX XXXX until I got answers. In XXXX of XXXX, I learned XXXX XXXX hired the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Nothing Attorney XXXX XXXX submitted to the Attorney General Office of Illinois around XXXX XXXX, XXXX sounded reasonable to me. Further, no one from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ever contacted me DIRECTLY, made XXXX phone call, left XXXX voice message instructing me to contact that LAW OFFICE, or delivered XXXX piece of mail instructing me to do the same. If any of this had occurred, I would have in turn, contacted an attorney and given that information to the attorney so that the attorneys could discuss the issues, not me. I was only instructed to contact XXXX XXXX, Customer Service Manager at XXXX and \\\" work out a mutually agreeable settlement in this matter \\'\\'. These instructions were typed within Attorney XXXX response to the Illinois Attorney General XXXX. To me, this sounded like yet another invitation to speak with another customer service representative and be further kicked around again. I chose not to engage.  For an entire year following, no one called or wrote me until XXXX when a male representative from CashCall began calling and left a message for me to contact his office to set up payment arrangements. Shortly after, in XXXX and XXXX XXXX, I received debt collection letters from CashCall informing me I now owed balances of {$12000.00} in XXXX XXXX, and {$12000.00} in XXXX XXXX : Both balances being well over and above the original amount of {$5000.00} borrowed. After checking my credit reports with XXXX in XXXX of XXXX, I discovered that CashCall followed through on their threats to report negatively on my credit reports therefore further damaging my chances to receive honest credit from honest lenders. Surprisingly, nothing was ever negatively reported regarding either XXXX XXXX, CashCall, or XXXX XXXX in XXXX, or XXXX. I believe the only thing I ever saw was either CashCall or XXXX XXXX listed as a creditor on my reports but neither ever reported any dollar amounts or payment histories.XXXX was never listed and they were the ones I got the money from. I also believe when I XXXX began to complain back in XXXX of XXXX, the only thing I did see on my credit report was a \\\" closed \\'\\' account. I thought since the account was \\\" closed \\'\\', nothing else could or would be reported. I will verify what happened with the credit bureaus on a normal working day for accuracy because today is a national holiday. I will later be attaching the results from the bureaus.  \"\n",

I made a mistake while writing the check I wrote XXXX in letter when I was supposed to write XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars and XXXX. When I checked my bank account I realized my mistake and hoping to fix that I wrote another check for XXXX and sent it to them before the deadline for the payment to be considered delinquent. Almost at the same time I received a letter saying the payment was sent toward principal and received a bill saying that the payment was directed toward the principal and they sent me a bill for {$2500.00}. Almost at the same time I also received an application for automatic draft from my checking. I filed it and sent it to them also. I thought the XXXX was for the months of XXXX and XXXX XXXX since I was up to date in my mortgage payment with the previous bank. Also I sent a check to cover for the month of XXXX since by experience it took time for the auto draft to be set and they also sent another letter saying the draft will start in XXXX They went into my account and withdraw the XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX then on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX my bank cleared the check written fir XXXX for XXXX. In total they got from me XXXX between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I called their customer service and spoke to a lady and asked her to reassign the amount of XXXX they wrong fully charged to me and withdrew from on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX toward the XXXX payment. She agreed to talk to them but refused to send to me a confirmation of our communication. In addition, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX I wrote them a long letter detailing all the payments to them including the fact that they wrongly charged me an extra month of mortgage for no reason. At that point I did not trust them and I put a stop on the autodraft. Sure enough, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received a bill for XXXX telling me that there was no fund to cover my XXXX mortgage. I called customer service again the same lady ( XXXX ) answered she said it was a mistake because the XXXX mortgage was paid from the previous money like I requested but because the autodraft was set to start in XXXX it was done automatically and I have to pay the XXXX dollar fee for insufficient fund. I sent them the a check with a note written on the coupon and staple to check saying that the account was closed do not go there any more and the mortgage will be mailed monthly to them. Yet they cashed my check for XXXX on XXXX and wrote me a letter on XXXX saying the mortgage for XXXX XXXX was not made when they submitted the auto draft and they want me to pay the XXXX fee for XXXX. I did not send it. Again I sent my XXXX payment they cashed the check on XXXX and again today I receive a bill saying I owed them XXXX now for returned fee. I do not trust them and I will not let them go play in my account anymore. If I did not close the autodraft you can see what would have happen again to me an my money. I do not want the XXXX and I want advise on what to do to stop them from going to my account every month like that when they already know that he autodraft is closed. Please help. I have the documentation for all the above. but I need someone to help me load that to you. or Can I fax them to you?  \"\n",

There is no possible way to get a phone number where humans answer and can assist ; there is no web site that does n\\'t send me into limbo, listing irrelevant answers to their canned questions, and then saying they can not help me without mailing in a request, which makes it impossible to get a loan. When I attempted to get a copy of my credit report via mail, they refuse to provide it listing insane requests for irrelevant information after weeks of waiting - all three did something similar in response to my request via mail for my free credit reports. This is ridiculous.   Your system here does not allow me to complain about the wide-ranging nuisance these companies are being allowed to impose upon consumers that just want them to do what they are supposedly requred to do by law. Obviously these bureaus have deliberately developed systems and processes that avoid equitable compliance with the law and are being allowed to get away with it by acting in complicity, with all XXXX not complying.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"Nationstar is the servicing bank : has held homeowner in extending processing, and not evaluating documents properly. Homeowner has submitted the RMA requesting modification. Homeowner has been denied by the service\\'r on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Homeowner is formally appealing the denial based on errors in home value, income, DTI and LTV Loan to Values used by the services in the denial of the RMA application.  The service\\'r has commenced double tracking while homeowner was acting in good faith under the DOJ/XXXX States Attorney Generals Agreement : the National Mortgage Settlement Agreement.   The servicer \\' is discriminating against homeowner claims, in a form of reverse discrimination ; holding the mortgage in extended processing, denying a loan modification while homeowner is qualified, lost documents when homeowner has already provided..   This homeowner, feels that her case has been unfairly treated for the following reasons : 1. No active single point of contact, constantly changing, when calls made to the single point of contact, routine routed to the collection department, never the same contact person.  2. A Single point of contact was assigned ; calls were made to the point of contact : the calls were never returned by the contact. Calls returned were from the collection department and never the same so called : \\\" relationship manager \\'\\'.  3. The service\\'r has held the homeowner in extended process in bad faith, during which the value of property has c for 26 months from XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX.  4. On the most recent RMA application : all requested documents were provided as requested. Homeowner has confirmation via fax that documents were received by the service 5. Homeowner has made numerous calls ( 20 ) inquiring on status of application, as a foreclosure date has been set XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; calls were routed to next available agent, comments were : A ) wrongfully advised that documents were not submitted, or B ) documents were submitted, or C ) resubmit documents because d, or D ) the foreclosure date is set and homeowner is responsible for not providing the requested documents : these XXXX points are causing a state of confusion and terror to the homeowner.  6. Servicer started a double tracking procedure upon the notice of default. The foreclosure agent was aware of the loan modification in process, and moved forward with the double tracking anyway.  This is a clear violation under the National Mortgage Settlement Agreement ; specifically double tracking while homeowner provided all documents under good faith.  7. Homeowner has contacted the foreclosure agent before the foreclosure sale : that the sale was extended to another 30 days. Service\\'r never advised homeowner of the extended sale date.  9. As of the above CFPB complaint date above, service\\'r has not advised or confirmation that the foreclosure date of sale is on hold.  10. Homeowner is in a state of fear created by the collection tactics by Service\\'r and or the foreclosure agent.  11. Homeowner was not advised of their HAMP/Department of Justice modification guidelines or options.  12. Homeowner was not provided the name of the investor as requested.  13. Homeowner was not provided a NPV Net Present Value Report to approve or deny the RMA application.   The Banks \\' failure to discharge their required loan modification obligations, during homeowner \\'s honest attempt to save their home from foreclosure.  Homeowner is claiming mortgage processing discrimination in delaying processing : by overloading servicer \\'s processing agents with a case work load of XXXX cases as per agents statement : ( disclosed by relationship manager via recorded conversation, for training and quality assurance ).   We formally appeal the loan modification denial. We request that a SPOC Special Point of C \\'\\' Contact be assigned to homeowner to assist in the new RMA application.  \"\n",

So I had to completely change my life as a XXXX year old kid and get an apartment so I could maintain my job.

       "         value: \"I am a XXXX year XXXX mom who has been driving for one year. I needed a car so that I could get to and from my full-time job. I found a used car dealer who also has financing. When I went to the dealer I was alone and thought I had enough basic knowledge about purchasing a used car. Well, after high pressure sales tactics I drove the car home. The very next day I went back to the dealer to return the car. They laughed and said that I could not return the car or get out of the contract. Worst part is they reminded me that if I do not make the payments they have a device on the car that shuts the engine off while driving. This seems so wrong on many counts. No XXXX else that bought a car has this device on the car. My credit was not even that risky it is just that I was only interested in a late model car, which new car dealerships do n\\'t offer. What a scam. I purchased a 2004 chevy with XXXX miles on it that was only worth less than {$2000.00} for {$19000.00}. I gave {$800.00} as a down payment and they also forced me to buy an extended warranty that does not cover anything that broke on the car while I have owned it. The car has had many breakdowns including the brake lines breaking with my baby in car, along with a rats nest in the engine. The dealer claimed to complete a full all points ( XXXX ) inspection prior when the mechanic said all the breakdowns should have been corrected with an inspection. My payments are {$200.00} biweekly and if I am even late XXXX day they shut off the car engine by remote control. PLEASE HELP ME. I believe what I have repaired and paid for this car exceeds what anyone should have paid. I wish to either have my money returned or keep the car and owe nothing. Thank you for you time.  \"\n",

There are some unresolved repair issues that is a ongoing issue sense I bought the car. I bought a extended Warranty and took the car in to be repaired in under two weeks after i bought it. The repair shop replaced a broken motor mount and transmission mount and told me the car was fixed but when i left the shop it still had the same problem. After taking it back to the dealership several times the issue never got diagnosed because of lack of concern by the dealership and their service manager, XXXX. XXXX was very rude and impossible to work with. I contacted Michael Wayne Investment out of frustration. It was at that time I was instructed by XXXX XXXX to stop making my payments until the repairs were resolved. So I did not make the payments. I started to get calls from their automated service everyday XXXX to XXXX times a day. I noticed when i would get in my car I heard a anoying beeping. Then my car would not start because they had it turned off by past time. Then because the repairs still have not been made XXXX XXXX started asking me when I am going to make my payment. So I started making the payments again, but because XXXX XXXX told me not to make several payments they are still calling me even the day after I make my regularly scheduled payments and tell me I am behind on my payments. I get calls early in the mornings all through the day and into the evening, and Sometimes tMy car wo n\\'t start because they turn it off. I have asked them to stop harassing me with the phone calls and told them I \\'m not behind on my payments because XXXX XXXX told me not to pay. I am stressed out bad because my account is past due and I am being called all the time. I never know when I am going to get I\\'n my car and it wo n\\'t start. I am a poor person with a single income and I live paycheck to paycheck. I ca n\\'t make more than XXXX payment at a time. it is wrong to treat customers this way. I wish I had never bought this vehicle. It is a bad car for my family. It has been in the shop XXXX times already sense XX/XX/XXXX and still not repaired. I do not have another vehicle to drive while this one is in the shop so many times.  \"\n",

The application was processed, but I failed to list a few expenses, so was told by a representative to resubmit. I resubmitted, but was then told I was approved for a repayment plan, which over doubled the payment, and could not reapply until the prior one was closed. I advised I only did what I was told. I ended up having to submit an application approximately XXXX times and each time was told the file was incomplete and closed, yet when I asked what was needed, was told nothing. I had submitted everything necessary. The process took over a year to finally get a result. The last time I resubmitted, the file was denied for rental income on a property that was not listed on my application, nor was referenced with my credit file. I advised this is not my property and there is no rental income. The file was denied, yet again. I spoke with my contact person, who confirmed it had been closed and for a wrong reason. She had also advised them this property was not mine. I emailed the president of US Bank at that time. The following day I receive a call advising to reapply. I told the individual I refused to reapply for the XXXX time, and the error was on their part. He resubmitted the file as it was, and it was then approved. The length of the process cost me excessive attorney fees due to a foreclosure process. I completed the trial plan, and also the modification. A partial claim was filed, which resulted in all the fees and arrearage being rolled into another mortgage. A few months ago, I made a payment over the phone, which the associate from US Bank input the information incorrectly. Results, the payment returned for an incorrect account number. The call for the payment was reviewed, and confirmed the bank made the error, again. Today, I still have a charge on the account for the returned item from the bank error. I have spoken with several people regarding this fee, to only be advised they do not know if they can remove it or not. I explained the fee was not due to my error or returned check, but due to the bank \\'s error. Still, they would not remove the fee. I have since advised the bank not to call my cell phone, but I still get calls at various times of the day and at times, 2-3 times a day through their dialer. I answer when the calls are received, only to have the bank hang up. Over the life of the loan, I have had the bank refuse my payments when XXXX was due, hang up on me when asking to speak with a supervisor, provide poor service on my account, and now charge me additional fees for their mistake. The end result will be I will lose the home due to these problems.  \"\n",

These crimes caused me to not be able to complete the renovations and subsequently pay the mortgage. The lender, Bank of America, in XXXX notified me of foreclosure proceedings and since I was out of state, I could not monitor the property. The bank winterized the home, boarded up the windows, and placed a for sale sign at the front of the property. In XXXX XXXX, I was notified by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to clean up the property to avoid a citation and fine for non-compliance for the upkeep. Upon further investigation, the County still listed me as the owner of the property and Bank of America never recorded a transfer of the title. After a laborious effort in trying find answers from Bank of America regarding the property, I was told that they confirmed the property was foreclosed upon and I would receive notice in the mail. In XXXX XXXX, Bank of America sent me a release of debt for the property rendering me responsible, to my surprise for the previous five years of property taxes. Today, as I am now aware I am the owner, the property taxes and penalty fees are more than the value of the property and prospective buyers are not willing to buy the property for obvious reasons. This practice by the bank appears to be a common unscrupulous act that I am now a victim of to include the municipality for not receiving it \\'s due taxes.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"Good-afternoon, I am submitting a complaint on Chex-systems because on or about XX/XX/XXXX I requested a Chex-systems report online because of an identity theft issue that I have. I reviewed my report and found a fraudulent account that was established in my name for the sole purpose to apply for a credit card in my name with XXXX XXXX, because if you are not an existing customer they require for you to apply in person. The identity thieves established this account and the account went in to charge off status once they used the credit card and deposits were never made to the account. There were also a list of fraudulent inquiries with several institutions they are as follows XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The last time that I applied for a checking account was with XXXX XXXX XXXX which they have been my bank since the merger of XXXX. I sent in a fax to Chex-systems with XXXX different police reports that were filed on separate months because of the continued theft against my personal information. I have had a lot of frustrations with this issue as it has been my responsibility in contacting each institution and notifying them of the theft. I am filing this complaint and attaching a copy of what was sent to chex-systems by fax, in hopes of clearing my name from any negative reporting and inquiries that have resulted from the fraud that has been committed against me. My file should be reporting free of any charge offs and no inquiries against my report as i have not applied for a checking account since XX/XX/XXXX.  \"\n",

He says I have to close the account and reopen. This is fishy to me because then I would be ineligible, as I received an offer within the last 18 months when I signed up the first time. He assures me I will get the new bonus, I just have to do that. So I close it with him.  A week later I apply again, this time making sure it \\'s a XXXX offer. I sign up and get the card, but I \\'m then told I \\'m not eligible because of exactly what I feared, I already signed up for a bonus when I applied the first time. I call Citi and they explain why I \\'m ineligible. She transfers me to customer service. They understand what I \\'m saying and after a long hold, say, \\\" We \\'ll get you the right bonus but you have to re-open the account you closed. \\'\\' OK.  I ask multiple times, \\\" The bonus I \\'m now eligible for is XXXX, right? \\\" Yes, yes and yes. He says to not worry about the XXXX account I opened, he \\'ll take care of it. Well today I get a letter in the mail, \\\" Thank you for re-opening your account, your card will arrive shortly. \\'\\' An hour later, I get an email I was \\\" approved \\'\\' for the XXXX account.  I have called back numerous times since then checking on the status of my account. Every single time, I get a different answer from a different person. I have been deceived by Citi and they continually do not honor the things they tell me.  Now they tell me I have XXXX accounts and I can not receive a bonus offer on either XXXX of them.

       "         value: \"Our loan appears to have several issues surrounding the mortgage assignments, loan transfers as well as recordings with our local property county accessor \\'s office here in XXXX County, XXXX. Our loan was originated by a fraudulent mortgage company based out of XXXX, XXXX named XXXX XXXX which was notably shut down for origination of predatory lending, and an assortment of illegal venues. The loan was the sold to XXXX XXXX, from there it was transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX was shut down, following XXXX XXXX filing bankruptcy XXXX XXXX, XXXX. According to OLS my loans custodial servicing rights were transferred from XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, how is this possible?  Furthermore, it is highly questionable that OLS, is in procession of all necessary sale affidavits, my allonge to the note as well as the additional applicable documentation that has been demanded of OLS. OLS, has possibly falsified and distorted the chain of title to our home and are attempting to force our home into foreclosure.This debt has been long disputed multiple times with multiple servicers with relation to the origination and predatory nature of my loan.XXXX, failed to protect my future financial interests and ultimately forced my loan into foreclosure as a result of ignoring basic underwriting guidelines as well as violations to The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) which prohibits unfair lending practices. Furthermore, there has been unfounded and incomplete evidence provided by OLS surrounding that the above mentioned loans origination, chain of title and assignments are unclear.Due to the OLS, failed response to my issues, I \\'m considering raising this matter in the Court as I feel it may be the proper venue for action under 28 U.S.C. Section 1391, because XXXX or more of the Defendants maintains executive offices in or conducts business in the district relevant to where real estate is located in this concern.  The interagency Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending enumerates certain tactics that may indicate predatory lending. Nonprofit groups have also published widely accepted guidance on these kinds of practices that may constitute predatory lending. Predatory loans typically combine risky loan features, thereby placing the borrower at an excessive risk of default or foreclosure.For purposes of this Complaint, \\\" Combined-Risk Loans \\'\\' are loans that meet the definition of high-cost loan under HMDA. HMDA, which is an extension of The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act ( HOEPA ) and enacted in XXXX as an amendment to the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) to address abusive practices in refinancing and home-equity mortgage loans with high interest rates or high fees. Loans that meet HOEPA \\'s high-cost coverage tests are subject to special disclosure requirements and restrictions on loan terms, and borrowers in high-cost mortgagesXXXX have enhanced remedies for violations of the law.XXXX ( XXXX ), was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. In subsequent paragraphs of this complaint, XXXX MORTGAGE will be referred to as \\\" XXXX, \\'\\' \\\" the lender \\'\\' or \\\" the defendant. \\\" XXXX \\'s business includes engaging in residential real estate-related transactions and regularly extending credit to persons. XXXX, as an entity whose business included engaging in residential real estate transactions -- including home equity lending as well as home purchase and refinancing lending -- is subject to the requirements of the XXXX XXXX XXXX, as amended, XXXX U.S.C. XXXX. XXXX is also a creditor as that term is defined by section 702 ( e ) of the ECOA, 15 U.S.C. 1692a ( e ), and is, therefore, subject to the requirements of the ECOA and its implementing Regulation B, as amended, 12 C.F.R.

I made payments for four months that were sufficient to pay off the six-month accounts on time as well as pay the minimum on the 24 month account. However, Synchrony allocated all of the payments to the 24 month interest bearing account. I noticed this in XXXX and spent over a half hour working with a representative who said she had corrected the problem but she never sent me the promised email confirming this. Then, the XXXX statement arrived and no corrections in payment allocation had been made. I spent another half hour today working with a representative to correct the payment allocation so that the promotional purchases would be paid off in time and the accrued interest would not be charged. The representative indicated that this would be reflected in my on-line account within XXXX hours. The fact that this allocation of payments does not happen automatically and that correcting it took an inordinate amount of time makes me think that this is intentional on the part of the credit card company as they then can collect the accrued interest. Most people do not have the time this has taken to resolve. If you have your payments on auto-pay, you might not even notice.  \"\n",

We included copies of our drivers licenses, social security cards, and a bill copy showing our residence.  Who else would want to fix mistakes on our credit reports but us?? We have written them before, and they know this, and they have written back. Are they now above the law and can make up an absurd excuse not to help people? This is the most absurd thing I have seen. Its absurd enough we keep writing clearly telling them things are wrong and they do nothing, but this is just beyond absurd.  We demand they respond immediately and hope the CFPB sanctions and fines them for this treatment of consumes at their mercy!  \"\n",

XXXX transaction was a XXXX withdrawl it was XXXX transaction that was split into XXXX total debits as each item shipped. This resulted in a total of {$180.00} in fees for {$140.00} worth of purchases. My account was never in the negative that I saw as it all posted at the same time when I looked at my account in the morning this occured everything seemed fine. Later that morning {$180.00} in fees were pending. I called and spoke with XXXX who told me my direct deposit should negate the fees and cause them to fall from a pending state and no one could help me until they posted and that the manager would do everything to help me tomorrow. Called next day was told XXXX the manager would call me back in 15 minutes 3 hours later no call back i called him. he finally returned my call and said that they will only waive {$74.00} a year. I explained that XXXX of the charged were of the result of XXXX transaction offered to provide proof. he said it was out of his hands he didnt have authority he would have district manager call me. the next day XXXX called and said he was acting as rep. of the bank the district manager would not be calling me and they would not be waiving any fees. 1. How can they charge me {$37.00} 4 times on XXXX transaction, and refuse to even look at the documenttaion. 2. If a direct deposit and charges both post at midnight the account was never in the negative state. 3.Is there no limit as to what they can charge and under what circumstance? 3. additionaly while I am adressing issues they have been randonly charging me XXXX per account per month on what is suppossed to be free military accounts and i have called several times they waive and \\\" fix \\'\\' it then randomly again I am charged these fees.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"This is our second complaint regarding our mortgage company ( Caliber Home Loans ) and our efforts to secure a loan modification. Our original complaint # was XXXX. We are submitting another complaint as we continuously believe that the escrow amount that Caliber has assessed is more than XXXX what is needed to cover all taxes. As a result of our original complaint, Caliber claimed that the total of all of our taxes are {$580.00} per month which we agree with. They are adding {$880.00} onto the {$580.00} for a total of {$1400.00} just for our escrow. This is more than than XXXX what is necessary. Consequently, our total mortgage payment is ridiculously high ( {$2300.00} ). We have been trying for some time to get a loan modification with Caliber. It has been difficult to say the least, and efforts to get any questions answered via phone is impossible as customer service representatives are unable to answer questions or direct us to someone who could answer the questions. Caliber recently offered us a loan modification agreement which resulted in the {$2300.00} per month payment which included an interest only payment of {$200.00} which we understand and {$690.00} which is an ancillary payment over a XXXX month period to cover taxes paid on our behalf. We understand this as well. Then, an escrow payment of {$1400.00} is being added onto that for our current and future taxes. The total of our taxes per year is {$7000.00}. When we reviewed Caliber \\'s breakdown that they revealed in the original complaint, {$580.00} per month was necessary to cover the {$7000.00} taxes for the year, and then they added {$880.00} per month onto that for a cushion. We feel that this escrow payment is ridiculously inflated and unnecessary ; however, Caliber will not consider a review to possibly reduce it. At the end of the year, with an escrow payment of {$1400.00}, we would have accumulated {$17000.00} which is enough to pay this year AND next year \\'s taxes and STILL have some left over. We just do n\\'t understand this at all. Please please please help us with this. We appreciate any help you can give us. To be honest, we are totally disgusted with Caliber Home Loans, and we do n\\'t trust them at all. The loan modification process was a nightmare as they told us that they do not participate in President O\\'Bama \\'s modification programs and would have to rely on their own in-house programs. We have watched unexplained charges accumulate at an alarming rate over the course of a year as well. We did n\\'t choose this company, we inherited Caliber. At this point, we just want the truth and an honest loan modification that we can trust and have faith in. The fact that Caliber representatives can not answer our questions or direct us to someone who can is so alarming and has us believing that this company is dishonest.  \"\n",

I quickly realized that I did not need a full year contract. After using the gym for no more than XXXX months, I proceeded to cancel it. Being given different information by different reps over at XXXX XXXX, they prolonged the process, telling e to wait months. And each month came and they would give me another excuse. They asked for proof of me being a minor and then told me that it was n\\'t enough. After months of a wild goose chase, I called my parent \\'s credit card company. They told me to not worry about it. I told them about the whole situation and how saw that others on the internet have also complained. They stop the charges and filed a complaint with the XXXX. We never heard about my membership since. All the online reviews seem to point toward exploitation of minors.  Now, within the last few days, First Credit Service have been nonstop calling my parents about this. Due to my parent \\'s XXXX, the rep asked for \\\" authorization \\'\\' to speak to me, the minor. I called them and asked about it. The numbers do n\\'t add up to my original plan. They stated that it was for XXXX months. This added up to XXXX dollars. I told them information about which they seem to have no idea about the situation. They say that I need to file a dispute about a balance that I thought stopped. They asked me questions about my family. It seemed like they were just trying to collect information. They seem to exploit fears I told them about thing becoming litigious. Also, a bad credit score. I \\'m turning XXXX. And they told me that they were on my side. \\\" call me a friend, \\'\\' they said. That \\'s when I realize how similar it was to a cliche scene of good cop, bad cop. It was a very manipulative conversation. Although they said stuff, a lot of stuff sounded open ended. They also told me that my dispute will take months and that it was not likely to go through. I asked about how it was going to be investigated. They told me that they will decide and I was baffled. It \\'s like saying that the procedure is for me to say what happened, then they say what happened, and then they decide who is right.  \"\n",

I would like Experian to know that I did in-fact send them a letter disputing information on my credit report. I also give Experian my expressed and written consent to continue with the investigation of my accounts per the dispute letter I wrote to them.  Since I have not experienced this situation before, I would very much appreciate Experian providing me with an explanation of my rights specifically pertaining to how I am allowed to dispute information on my credit report.  I would also like to know specifically what made my letter \\\" suspicious \\'\\' and why Experian thinks I did not write my letter to them. Did I say something in my letter that they think I am not smart enough to write myself?  I have reviewed Experian \\'s website to determine what steps I am required to take to dispute my accounts and thought I had followed all instructions : I sent in a copy of my ID, proof of my social security number and proof of my address. I would be very grateful for a step by step explanation from Experian detailing the specific information I may have missed from their website.  I would like Experian to let me know if I am allowed to re-write my letter, and if so, would Experian be so kind as to provide me with an example of a letter that would be acceptable to them?  I am just a regular person and do not have the money to be represented by an attorney or any other agency. I work all day and can not afford to take time off work to dispute my accounts. So I would like Experian to tell me if completing a dispute over the phone would provide me with the same outcome as a letter? And if the results would be the same, why is Experian choosing to not accept my letter and my humble request for an investigation of my accounts?  \"\n",

It was never disclosed that just because we applied for loan modification Chase will paid in our behalf property taxes.

Shortly after taking over the loan from CW, BOA began adding escrow reserve to my escrow account. My loan does not require me to use escrow servicing, it \\'s voluntary. Upon adding escrow reserve, BOA raised my minimum pmt. While paying the correct amount, BOA began to claim my payment was short of full. This lead to payments being considered late, late fees, etc.   Additionally, BOA \\'s escrow servicing has repeatedly paid insurance to XXXX incorrectly. Payment from XXXX property made to a wrong XXXX. This lead to overpayment to XXXX and a refund to me ; meanwhile leaving the unpaid insurance account short ( as it was never properly paid ). This lead to a repeat of all said above in late fees, etc.   Most recently, they began foreclosure proceedings on one of my rental properties. This despite having record of sufficient payment made each and every month. The first trustee called off the sale and sent the file back to BOA after I provided them my records. Now a new trustee has been appointed and they \\'ve postponed the sale to review my information. I \\'m quite tired of this continual process.   I have a file XXXX \\'\\' thick of letters sent to BOA with minimal response and never any serious attempt at resolution. In my paperwork sent to BOA is included a spread sheet displaying all loans, payments for each year with taxes and insurance and my payments. It quite clearly shows that I \\'ve paid more than was required. Despite this, they have each loan in error and it \\'s a complete mess.   This is not the first occasion. In 2009, BOA admitted wrongdoing of all the above and corrected my accounting and all was set current. However, shortly thereafter the whole process began again.   I \\'m not sure if it is a predatory business practice or not, but I \\'m sure I \\'m not the only one experiencing this. My credit has been ruined and I \\'ve been unable to close on transactions and lost hundreds of thousands of dollars.   I \\'ve pleaded with BOA to have someone at high level work through the file and find resolution. No success.  \"\n",

The rep explained to me that the bank viewed my account as a whole credit line and not as separate accounts. The rep said that when I got the travel rewards card that my account credit line would be slightly reduced by the amount of the credit line that they gave me on the new card. but, he stated that once I received my new card, I could call in and have the entire credit line moved from the old account to the new account and I could close my old account.   On XX/XX/XXXX I received my new card and proceeded to call Bank of America to transfer my credit line but was told by the rep that I was unable to do that and that I could only do it once my balance was paid off or paid down enough to transfer the amount due. I told the rep that that was not what I was told when I opened the account. So I spoke with her manager, XXXX and she said that she could n\\'t do it as well. But she did open a case XXXX and said that she escalated my problem and that they would investigate it and give me a reply by next week. I told her that I believed that her bank committed fraud by promising one thing and not delivering once I opened the new account. I told the manager I would file a complaint with the ftc.  \"\n",

He was never given written OR verbal authorization to do so. They have no documentation of any sort signed by me in connection with this proposed loan -- no XXXX ( I never filled one out ) or any other disclosures, and certainly no authorization to pull credit.  TO NOTE : From the time of the aforementioned credit pull in XX/XX/XXXX, my XXXX score dropped from XXXX to XXXX. I contacted their escalation department & spoke with XXXX who \\\" investigated \\'\\' & called me on XXXX XXXX to tell me it \\\" seems like a he-said-she-said situation \\'\\' and that he could do nothing. I said I had an emails wherein I questioned LO about why he had pulled my credit ( as well as why I was getting no contact or proper communication from him on any level ), and he asked me to send those to him. To my dismay, on XXXX XXXX he replied in part : \\\" I \\'m compelled to say that I think we do n\\'t have enough information that it was understood that your credit would be pulled. Your email did n\\'t state anything in regards to not telling the HMC to pull your credit. Unfortunately we will not be able to have the credit pull removed from your credit report \\'\\'.  Being a former loan officer myself ( from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ), I am shocked that a financial institution has the right to intimate that I have to tell them NOT to pull ( which I did! ) or that ( perhaps any ) consumer would/should simply \\\" understand \\'\\' their credit would be pulled! I ALWAYS GOT SIGNED AUTHORIZATION from my consumers! I \\'m further shocked that this loan officer can just ( apparently ) say I gave him verbal authorization?! And XXXX stated in our phone conversation on XXXX XXXX that me providing some documentation ( again, never filling out an application NOR signing the authorization to pull credit! ) was considered by them as me \\\" understanding that my credit would be pulled \\'\\' ....  Can you please help me? It \\'s a real matter of principal for me.  \"\n",

I modified my mortgage with them in XXXX, which was quite an ordeal because they lost my documents numerous times and caused 9 months delay, causing more interest and they added {$3000.00} in attorney \\'s fees. They added {$4300.00} capitalized to the balance of my loan at that time to correct the escrow account. There was no shortage until they started adding approximately {$160.00} each month as a cushion to my escrow account. That \\'s over {$1900.00} a year of my money that they are using.  My issue with them currently is that they will not allow me to pay my home insurance and taxes directly. A year ago I started paying taxes and insurance directly because Nationsta r was cushioning my escrow account in excess of maximum that the Maine State law allows. I sent them a statement telling them I would be paying directly and why. I asked for a waiver form to cancel my escrow account and proof that my insurance was paid for the next year and continued to request this every month while I also sent proof of my tax and insurance payments. Nationstar is in violation of Section 10 of the RESPA which states the limits on escrow accounts. Please see the XXXX pages of documents I have attached to this complaint to prove my case.  \"\n",

XXXX XXXX has unlawfully reported this account intending to affect my credit rating and willfully reported me as delinquent. This is grossly inaccurate. I have submitted a request for full disclosure of the investigative process carried out by XXXX to verify said debt, and sent a copy of the letter to XXXX XXXX corporate headquarters in New Jersey. I have filed an FTC complaint against XXXX XXXX.  XXXX XXXX has committed several violations of the FCBA and FCRA, including but not limited to, threatening my credit rating, reporting me as delinquent, willfully failing to acknowledge my billing dispute, failing to apply/post credits, charges for goods and services you did n\\'t accept or that were n\\'t delivered as agreed, and unauthorized charges for data when I only agreed to start service under the promise of an unlimited data flat rate plan for XXXX phone line. TransUnion has equally violated laws protecting against that to which I \\'ve been subjected because they have failed to decide this matter according to law. My documents clearly show that I have initiated my billing disputes timely and properly. The mere submission of a bill statement from XXXX is legally insufficient as peremptory evidence that the XXXX account balance is accurate. That just gross bias. My documentation is not being taken seriously. My complaints are not being taken seriously and meanwhile XXXX XXXX is still wrongfully report me as delinquent and has never even so much as acknowledged my billing dispute.  \"\n",

This is a scam for Nationstar to continue to milk the servicing of this loan and eventually foreclose. They have not received any better or higher offers and they have scared away every buyer we have had by asking them to pay the full offered price plus 5 % on top for a service no one wants to use. Why would a Buyer we have already procured go and bid on a home and pay more for the house? Whats ends up happening is they offer less to make up the difference in the cost. In addition XXXX sets the opening bids low and congratulatesBuyers when they \\\" win \\'\\' the Auction. Then the bank turns around and tell us the bid was too low and the investor rejected the offer. We asked that they stop this useless practice and look at the offer at hand, they refuse. They have been sued in the past by other parties because of their fraudulent practices and we are asking that you reach out to them and request they take this matter very seriously. They are wasting the sellers time, every buyer who has come along, our time and the time if their investor. Thank you for your assistance!  \"\n",

Our house is currently in the state court awaiting a hearing to set the house for sale. Before all of this happened we have been consistently behind one month of our mortgage payment ( {$3100.00} ) for about a year and a half. On XX/XX/XXXX the bank informed us that if they did n\\'t receive both payments that they will start the foreclosure process for our property, this is when we decided to get a lawyer to helps us to modify our loan. At this time we stopped paying the mortgage in our house too see if the bank would help us. The bank denied us more than XXXX to modify our loan according to our foreclosure lawyer. The bank concluded that the reason for denial was because we make too much money, and they go back to 31 % of gross income which I feel is not a realistic figure. We have held a mortgage with this bank since XX/XX/XXXX with our previous house and were good customers. We feel they have been unjust and really want our home. All we wanted was a lower monthly payment so we can manage with our monthly expenses.  My wife and I are both XXXX and have XXXX daughters. This whole process has been so stressful. We wanted to start making payments again but they only wanted the entire balance and have not been willing to assist. We also tried to do a short sale which they again would not consider any short sale. My wife was XXXX seven years ago and it has been hard on all of us. Our daily life is affected in all ways and she XXXX. Stress is not good for this XXXX but then again the bank apparently does not care. We were just behind XXXX payment and they would n\\'t accept it unless it was the complete amount at the start of this whole process. Lawyers have been amazed on how the bank has treated us and not considered any options. We just wanted our bank to help us solve our current situation to modify and lower our current loan with the monthly moorage payment {$3100.00}.  \"\n",

I received the denial letter with the information concerning the application. As I read the letter it stated that they used Experian as the CRA to help them determine the application. Then it told me that if I sent an UPDATED copy of my credit report within 30 days, that they would re-evaluate `this` application. I was already in the process of getting some things corrected on my credit reports. Once I received the corrected reports I then sent them that updated copy as they noted to do so in the letter to their XXXX XXXX address. I sent it certified 2 day priority mail on XXXX XXXX. Upon reviewing my credit report today XXXX XXXX, 2015, I noticed a new hard inquiry on my credit report from XXXX. I could n\\'t understand why that was because I had not applied for anything with them since XXXX XXXX 2015. So I called them to question this issue. They claimed I requested a new application because I sent them an updated copy of my credit report. That is FALSE. I did NOT authorize a new application nor a new hard pull from my Experian credit report. Their response was that a re-evaluation of a credit app requires a new hard pull for which they did not notify me or request my permission to do so. Further more why on earth would you ask me to send you my most recent updated credit report, which I did, if you were going to do a hard pull anyway and not use it. That makes no since. Also if I only had 30 days to re-evaluate, and if I missed that deadline, and today being XXXX XXXX, then it should not have been done to begin with. I did not agree to a new application. This is a very deceitful practice and very dishonest. Below at the bottom is an excerpt of the denial letter sent to me showing that they only required an UPDATED hard copy be mailed to them. Nothing mentioned that they will unnecessarily rerun my credit or that it is a part of the process. The credit lady I spoke to XXXX ( And I do have the employee ID if needed ), was unwilling to help me with this because this was clearly unauthorized. The letter I provided with the credit report shows that I was also under the assumption the purpose of the report I sent was for the purpose of re-evaluation. I do not want and will not have that unauthorized inquiry dated XXXX XXXX 2015 on my XXXX report.  ________________________________________________________________________________Important information for youOur credit decision was based, in whole or in part, on information obtained in a report from the following consumer reporting agency : XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Please note, other than providing information, the reporting agency played no part in our decision and is unable to supply the specific reasons why we denied your request.

US Bank charges the same amount money for less card member benefit, that is how they make profits!

My realtor has a prospective buyer but we are running into extreme difficulty. A valuation was placed on the property, by Nationstar I believe, that is high for what the property has to offer, and the condition that it is in. I have submitted pictures, repair quotes, and a CMA to document the high valuation, but Nationstar is telling us that they wo n\\'t review it. XXXX has given Nationstar free reign to do what they want, so consequently they are not reviewing pertinent documents and informing XXXX. Nationstar is trying to force me into a foreclosure even though there is an offer on the table that is very reasonable, XXXX that brings 94 % of the CMA value to the investor. And if we factor in the repair quotes of nearly {$10000.00}, the current offer brings 98 % of the CMA value! We are finding it difficult to comprehend that the investor would turn down such an offer if they were fully aware of it, which they wo n\\'t be if Nationstar does n\\'t review the documentation we are submitting and shares it with them!   My realtor has been going back and forth with Nationstar and XXXX trying to find someone to give a serious look at the documentation that I have pulled together to refute Nationstar \\'s valuation, but is getting nowhere. They feel that working through XXXX does n\\'t get them to someone who will actually take a real look at the case. THERE IS A FORECLOSURE SALE SET FOR XXXX XXXX, 8 DAYS AWAY. Both my realtor and I continue to try make headway, but Nationstar refuses to bring this to the attention of someone who will take a serious look at the documentation that shows their valuation is high. And XXXX agents are n\\'t getting either of us to someone who has the authority to get involved and take a serious look at the valuation. I do n\\'t think they are aware that Nationstar is pushing this property to foreclosure when there is such a good offer on the table.  \"\n",

Then XXXXI received a bill with a due date of XXXX XXXX that included a late feefee for XX/XX/XXXX of {$25.00}. As you can see, this charge should\\'NEVER \\' have been applied because my wife was not just XXXX ahead of payments but several months. I dounderstand that sometimes computer billing systems maynot understand payments made in advance so I calledcustomer service and asked to speak to a supervisor andwas handled by XXXX. She saw the advanced paymentsyet she said she would not remove the late fee. This fee isactually a fee for paying early!! ABSURD!!! I want this XXXX not \\\" waived as a courtesy \\'\\' as smugly as XXXX stated, but I want it removed because a fee for early paymentshould never happen. XXXX calls it a late fee, I call it beingpunished for paying early. XXXX also claims that a \\'\\' courtesy \\'\\' waiver \\'\\' was already issued on the very XXXXpayment. This should never have happened either. XXXX Jewelers said we would be billed in XXXX days butinstead we were billed immediately. When my wife noticedshe may be late if she paid online because it was alreadythe day of the due date, she went directly to XXXX XXXX and paipaid it with assurance that your firm would be called and the billbill be posted as paid on time. My wife listened XXXX on thephone to make sure things were taken care of. XXXX is nowstating that this constituted a \\\" waiver \\'\\' for a late payment.  Once again this was paid on time, albeit the same day due, but every payment since then was paid in advance!! At notime was our account EVER late!!! I want this {$25.00} fee takenoff of my bill, not as a courtesy but because it does n\\'t belongthere in the XXXX place and neither was the XXXX incident. I alsowant XXXX taken aside and retrained in handling customers.  She ended the call with a \\'smug \\' \\\" Is there anything ELSE Ican help you with \\'\\'? XXXX did n\\'t help me at all. She alsowould n\\'t give me her bosses name or number in order for meto climb up the chain of command. XXXX stated that shehad the last word. Does XXXX run your firm or does sheanswer to someone else? If she does answer to someoneelse which I know she does, she needs to be made aware ofthis. Customers are owed satisfaction not insults!! Rescindthis late fee immediately or I will take further legal action.  A very dissatisfied customer!!!  \"\n",

       "         value: \"I attended XXXX University from XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX and have been making nearly $ 600/m payments ever since I left the school to Great Lakes / XXXX XXXX. Great Lakes is servicing my private loans through XXXX XXXX. I have been unemployed for a few months, but have continued to make my payments until this month due to lack of funds. My payments are due on XX/XX/XXXX, and I called Great Lakes on XX/XX/XXXX to request a forbearance or deferment. They gave me the info to do so on my federal loans, but advised me that despite being proactive, I needed to wait until I was 1 day past due on my private loans before I would be eligible for a forbearance. I called back to Great Lakes on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that I met all the qualifications for forbearance and was given a number to XXXX XXXX to call to have it placed on my account as they were only the servicer. I was asked how long I would need, and when I advised it would probably be until XX/XX/XXXX for sure before I could resume payments, she told me that would be fine. When I called XXXX XXXX, and incredibly rude woman answered and told me that XXXX XXXX only offers a 2 month extension, and they are under no obligation to offer me anything else. The issue though was that they will only offer it to me if I am employed - they have no options for those that are unemployed and can not make payment. I was told to call Great Lakes back to figure out what the issue was. When I called back, a rep named XXXX answered and gave me the exact same information about the forbearance and that I should call XXXX XXXX back and ask to speak to a manager. When I called XXXX XXXX, I spoke to a rep named XXXX who said there was no manager available. XXXX though was very helpful and explained that Great Lakes had incorrectly told me to allow my payment to go past due, causing my account to go delinquent, and that I could have applied for an extension before missing the payment. We did a 3 way call with Great Lakes where the conversation included statements where XXXX XXXX had told Great Lakes numerous times that this was not one of their programs, yet their system has not been updated, and they \\'ve received many calls like mine over the last few months. I was escalated to another rep at Great Lakes where again they began speaking of forbearance \\'s that do not actual exist. When I asked about late charges and reporting to my credit even though I had been given incorrect information, they said there was nothing they could do to stop it. XXXX from XXXX XXXX offered to submit a 2 month extension request, but advised I would probably be denied since I do not have a steady income. He still submitted the request, but made me give a 100 % guarantee that I would be able to resume payments after the 2 months, even though I am still unemployed and have no current income.   I am in disbelief that Great Lakes and XXXX XXXX have a level of miscommunication that would cause GreatLakes to give advice to a student to allow their account to become to delinquent to apply for a program that does not actually exist, and then not offer anything to help resolve the situation. I also can not believe that XXXX XXXX has nothing available for people who are unemployed and can not make a payment. When it came down to it, my only options were to make the payment, or let it go into default and eventually to collections where I would be assessed late charges, and collections fees ( which usually average around XXXX % of the outstanding balance, which in my case would be an additional $ XXXX I would owe ). If those are my only options, it will be the last time I ever do business with XXXX XXXX. Again, I was told to let my account go delinquent, and now am being told that should never have been the case.   I would like to have the correct information and all miscommunications resolved for future students in my same scenario.  \"\n",

I never applied for a card from XXXX XXXX, my son applied without my knowledge. My son was not employed on a regular basis when he received the credit card.

I suggested that he authorize me to negotiate on his behalf since I did n\\'t want him to impair his credit which could negatively impact his job prospects. I had no knowledge that by doing so the bank would add me as a borrower and report the delinquency on my credit report XXXX. I called on his behalf and was unable to negotiate anything since the bank insisted the debt be paid off within XXXX months. I told them he could repay it within a year after completing an unpaid internship that is to hopefully lead to a paid job. I knew he did n\\'t have the financial means to pay off the debt currently. I told the bank official I did n\\'t want to pay off his debt since it would n\\'t teach him a financial lesson. My refusal to pay off debt my son incurred on a credit card he should not have been issued resulted in XXXX XXXX reporting the delinquency as mine. I have spent years maintaining excellent credit and pay my bills on time and in full each month. The actions XXXX XXXX took by reporting my adult son \\'s delinquency as mine is wrong.

The explanation given was the following : ( 1 ) Too many missed payments on other monthly accounts.  First, I do not have ANY missed payments or collection accounts reporting on either of my credit reports. Secondly, and to justify the denial, Capital One Bank stated that my credit utilization rate was too high. My credit utilization rate may be higher than 30 percent, however this has nothing to do with my ability to repay my accounts on time each month.  As a matter of practice, credit card issuers make their money off credit account holders such as myself ; That is those who routinely carry a balance. Therefore, the reasons for denying the credit limit increase have nothing to do with my ability to pay my bill on time. Also, the request was made almost 6 months ago and I currently have a higher credit score than I did at that time, however still am not eligible for a higher credit limit.  I also believe that due to the number of CFPB complaints made against Capital One Bank, I am being denied credit with the bank.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"To Whom It May Concern ; Back in XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX we applied for XXXX of those Making Home Affordable loans with Wachovia which is Wells Fargo now, because me and my husband, both lost our jobs. Those loans were supposed to be 30 year fixed loans and the usually reduce your principle balance so you will have a smaller payment that you can afford. Well first they said we did n\\'t make enough money, so we had to add my daughter \\'s income to show more income so they would approve us, because I was on unemployment. And then when we finally got temporary approval, first we had to make XXXX payments on time and then it was made a permanent loan. Well to start with our payment before we got this loan was about {$910.00} after our temporary loan was approved, our payment went up to {$1000.00}, starting on XX/XX/XXXX, then XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX, so our payment went up instead of down, they did n\\'t reduce our principle balance like they should have so our payment would be smaller, that was the purpose of the Making Home Affordable loans, but that never happened. Plus it should have been a 30 year fixed, but it was n\\'t because we just noticed that in XXXX of this year our payment will increase and again in XX/XX/XXXX it will increase again. I do n\\'t know if you can help us out and do anything about it since our loan was done wrong, because it did n\\'t make the payment affordable to us so we could pay it ourselves, so for now my mother in law pays our house payment for us because we ca n\\'t afford it and she does n\\'t want us to lose our home, but she ca n\\'t do that forever. We need to get this loan corrected the way it should have been. Because my sister that lives in XXXX, CA got a Making Home Affordable loan last year in XXXX and they reduced her principle balance and her monthly payment went from {$1500.00} a month to {$500.00} a month, that \\'s the correct way it should be done. So can you please let me know if you can do anything and help us to get our loan corrected? Please help us out if you can!!!!! Let me know what info you need from us, if you can help us. Thanks!!!

A small charge of about XXXX dollars went on the card in XX/XX/XXXX, I never received the XX/XX/XXXX statement so no payment was made. When the next statement came it had penalty and interest so i called to find out why and discovered the missing statement, I paid that day the total bill plus an extra {$200.00} so that there would be no more interest. On the next statement there is still an interest charge, called and company rep acknowledged the extra payment but said still assessed interest because they charge interest until the next statement even when there is a credit on the account. Refuse to do anything about the charge. I think this is an abusive practice. For a missed payment of about {$20.00} where I never got the statement I have already paid {$22.00} in fees and {$35.00} in interest, then on an over paid account more interest is charged.  \"\n",

I communicated with a collection agency Hunter Warfield on a debt that I owed to them. I set up to where I settled for a disclosed figure and was told by the employee ( XXXX XXXX ) that it would be taken off my credit within 24hrs of final payment. well I called and tried to figure out how to go about making sure that this was taking off my credit as I had already been able to go and print out the receipt of payment where it states that the collection had been XXXX out and settled in full. Upon trying to do so I spoke with another employee who submitted a manual notification stating that it had been settled as well to the credit company and provided me with the AUD Update Control Number to provide to the credit company as well. Upon contacting the credit company I was informed that it was going to be up to the collection company as to whether or not they remove it off my credit. I called Hunter Warfield back and was transferred to a lady by the name of XXXX XXXX who did n\\'t seem to want to try and hear me out at all and started out by cutting me off and stating that she did n\\'t care what some credit company had told me that she had the say so on whether or not it be removed. XXXX XXXX also went on to inform me that if I did n\\'t be quiet and listen to what she had to say that I was n\\'t definitely going to have anything moved off of my credit. I tried explaining to her that an employee of Hunter Warfield had told me that the debt would taking off my credit once the debt was paid in full. XXXX XXXX informed me that she was n\\'t going to take it off and that it would stay on there for another year and half because I waited for so long to try and pay. she completely disregarded me for a customer and overlooked the fact that I was trying to inform her that I have a XXXX month old and a XXXXmonth old who I am trying to provide housing for and that I was n\\'t able to due that as long as that was still showing up on my credit and so now here still my children and my wife are having to stay with a family member on their couch because she refused to take the collection off my credit and was nasty as all get out with it. I also informed her that I was recording the call as I do with all important calls and she then tried changing her story but it was to late by then. I tried calling back and she has not returned my call or anything to try and get this resolved.  \"\n",

You had asked for additional information to the four months of credit card statements showing the charges on my card but since I was not the renter I did not have the rental documents and I am guessing that you chose to drop my case as opposed to investigating it. I just found my documentation from the XXXX complaint I had filed with detailed information on the company that I had lacked when I filed both of my previous complaints so I will submit a copy with this follow-up complaint in hopes of getting something done to get my money refunded to my credit card, plus the interest and fees that continue to increase that debt every month.  \"\n",

As our use of this card is occasional and only used at Macy \\'s, we depended on the Bill Pay process and paid when notified a bill was due. When the account changed to XXXX, apparently the bill pay information did not transfer. This would have been OK, assuming that they notified us via email or with a paper statement that an amount was due. Last night, our card was declined at Macy \\'s and we were informed that we were overdue and owed {$480.00} dollars, including late fees and finance charges of {$120.00}! When we called, we were offered a relief of {$38.00} dollars, which we declined and disputed the fee. When asked how the billing statement was delivered, the agent said via email. When asked what email was used, the agent could not cite the email. Effectively, we were not billed or notified that we were behind payments in any way. If we had not attempted to use the card, the charges would have continued to accrue. We immediately paid the amount due, but their is no way to dispute the late fees and finance charges.

Also, now that I am able to pay and would like to start a formal payment plan, the hospital staff said they could not since they had sent the debt to a collector, even though they can accept payments on the debt and record it in their billing system.  The collector has placed a collection record on my credit report, though they do not contact me since in my XXXX contact with them I stated that I was making payments directly to the creditor.

       "         value: \"On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I purchased a washer and dryer on my Sears Credit card from the Sears in XXXX, TN. My purchase included the washer, dryer, washer hoses, dryer vent, dryer hose, stacking kit, delivery and installation. I was in the process of remodeling my laundry room, so I set the date of delivery for XXXX/XXXX/2015. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 XXXX deliverymen brought the hoses, vent, and cord, nothing else. After a call to the warehouse, the store, and the XXXX number, it seems someone rescheduled without informing me. Then it was later discovered that they did n\\'t have the stacking kit. I proceeded to reach out to Sears again via phone and social media on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and finally managed to get the washer and dryer. I was informed I \\'d have to make further arrangements to complete my order and installation ( setting up the appliances with the stacking kit ). I \\'ve had no contact until I called the XXXX number today. First they tried to lead me to believe my order was complete. When I corrected the info, I was put on hold. The woman came back on and said my part was at the store and that I could call there. I have since called someone I believe to be the manager in the appliance dept, Sears at XXXX and explained what was going on. He has yet to call me back. I used my Sears card and have been making my payments on something that I purchased on an obligation that has not been fulfilled. I \\'ve been fulfilling my end of the bargain by making my payments and would just like Sears to do the same by completing my order and installation. The run around I have received is ridiculous and their handling of my order has been unsatisfactory. I \\'m hoping that maybe someone outside of Sears inner circle may be able to assist me in this matter.  \"\n",

They told my mom and sister, no worries he doesnt need to. At that point my mom offered to go on the lease with her to replace me as well. They told her she was not needed either, all payments were made on time, and my sister was fine. The rental company clearly knew I wasnt ok with being tied into the lease agreement for a second year. My sister got in legal trouble towards the emd of the lease. The rental company calls me saying i am responsible for the place and that I need to come get her stuff. I made it clear then I was to be removed from the lease. They started to argue with me so I went in in person. They told me they just wanted to get her stuff out that they were not going to come after her to collect on the lease. So I dropped it and removed her belongings from the apartment. Well a couple months later I get a bill for XXXX + dollars. I called immediately and was given the run around again. I asked for a copy of the lease they said sure come pick it up. I drove the whole way to them, and they said I cant have a copy of the lease. They also refused to give me a copy of the move out report from my sisters roomates for the first year she was there. As alot of damages that were on this bill were done by them, as well as my sister. They could not produce those documents either. I told them I wasnt responsible for the debt. I have told the collectiom agency the same story, and the gentleman on the phone tried to threaten me. Saying I will mo longer be able to buy a home, or a car with my credit of I dont pay. Which is a total lie and made me angry. I secure loans for people for a living other than this mess i have over XXXX on time payments on record without XXXX late payment. I pay MY debts.

       "         value: \"WellsFargo Bank N.A. Credit Card Limit Increased I obtained a credit card through Wellsfargo at age XXXX, upon beginning my university career. From age XXXX to the present, over XXXX seeing through my responsibility my credit card payments has been a priority. Upon losing my full time employment position in XXXX due to the recession, I was provided with a severance pay equal to a little over {$8000.00}. At the time I owed Wellsfargo Bank \\'s Credit Card company about {$8000.00}. I paid the balance in full.  After I lost my middle class job in XXXX. So I worked XXXX jobs ( XXXX ) as a XXXX and ( XXXX ) for the XXXX, my income was below the poverty line. I took the XXXX and made it into XXXX School. In XXXX, a period in which I made an income lower than the poverty line and later as a XXXX student Wellsfargo continued to raise the credit limit on the credit card issued to me until it reached about {$20000.00}. In addition, while having no stable source of income and as a student they provided me with a personal line of credit in the amount of {$9000.00}. They did so, without my requesting them to do so, and without taking into consideration whether or not I was employed, nor taking into consideration my income.  Customer Service Upon graduating from XXXX School, I was extended the great privilege of accessing a incredible job offer where my income would have been above {$90000.00} per year. The XXXX exam, however, has been a barrier. I did not pass the exam the XXXX time ( XXXX XXXX exam ). I had to take the exam a XXXX time, with no income and while unemployed, I was forced to look to my Credit Card and my Personal Line of Credit to take on that XXXX exam endeavor XXXX more time.  Forbearance Denied Before taking the XXXX exam a XXXX time I called Wellsfargo \\'s Credit Card company. I explained I was unemployed, a student, and that I could foresee a struggle with payments. I requested a Forbearance similar to Federal school loans. They informed me they could do nothing to help me and was asked to pay an even greater amount of money than my original required amount that month.  I was unemployed at the time and knew I would fall behind if I did n\\'t get help. So I began to live off my personal line of credit, and to use it to pay my Credit Card to keep up with the payments, I simultaneously worked to find a employment and was unsuccessful. Because I had this a life changing job offer still accessible if I passed the XXXX, I felt the reasonable thing to do was to try to get the XXXX Exam again. If I passed, I \\'d pay off all my debt in no time and I could provide for me and a better quality of life for my family. Sadly, I did not pass the exam the XXXX time ( XXXX XXXX ). After take the exam in XXXX I looked for work vehemently. I was unable to secure stable income until XXXX XXXX. My paychecks average {$1000.00} to {$1200.00} a month. I work 40 hours a week, 5 days a week.  Delinquent Account I began to struggle to keep up with my credit card debt towards the end of the summer of XXXX. Once I secured employment and knew I \\'d be paid in the upcoming month or so I called WellsFargo to see if we could coordinate a more manageable payment plan. The interest rates were lowered. I believed I would be able to make monthly payments of about {$350.00}. So I borrowed a significant sum from a friend and got the account caught up in the Fall of XXXX. Once I had an income {$460.00} went to rent, {$200.00} went to food, {$250.00} to gas. I was unable to to keep up. Excessive late fees have accrued, closing canceling of accounts too. I spoke to Wellsfargo representative in the recovery department yesterda, XXXX XXXX, XXXX at about XXXX. I was given XXXX options. To pay the entire sum of the credit card debt over the course of ( XXXX ) three years at {$630.00} per month or ( XXXX ) one year at a rate of {$1100.00} per month. A sale of account is planned.

In XXXX 2015, I obtained financing and paid off the Ditech mortgage and became full owner of the property. Prior to closing Ditech informed XXXX XXXX that they did not collect enough money from the existing impound account to cover the property taxes which resulted in a {$2500.00} shortfall. Ditech demanded the {$2500.00} tax shortage be paid through escrow prior to closing the loan. I spoke with Ditech Customer Service Supervisors and I was told there was an existing impound account and if I paid the tax shortage through escrow ALL the taxes would be paid directly by Ditech to the State of Texas. Upon receiving this information from Ditech, I proceeded in good faith and paid the tax shortage and the Ditech loan was paid off. Currently, Ditech is refusing to pay the taxes they have already collected and instead, are sending the full tax payment to my partners as a tax refund! Clearly, this is a violation of my consumer rights. The taxes were collected through the impound account, I paid an additional {$2500.00} for property taxes. XXXX XXXX is holding an additional {$6400.00} in an escrow account because the Property taxes have not been paid! If Ditech does not pay the property taxes, Ditech has deliberately misinformed me and collected funds based on false statements made to me.  \"\n",

On or about XX/XX/XXXX I was almost 3 months behind on my mortgage and I tried to pay for two months of payments and they refused to take the payments and they then stated they could n\\'t help me until I was three months behind. My lawyers have submitted documents to request a loan modification but within a 2 month period they state that I make too much or not enough. I now have a sale date of XX/XX/XXXX. So its clear they have no intention to honor a loan modification. I received a loan modification on or about XX/XX/XXXX but it was still a financial burden. I excepted the terms because they stated If I did n\\'t it they would terminate the loan modification and I would have to start all over again. As a XXXX XXXX veteran I \\'m not suppose to pay property tax but they still charge me. In addition, we had a certified forensic loan audit which depicted fraud on the loan. Our XXXX report revealed our note was split-apart or fractionalized, as separate accounting entries and deposited ach Class is insured up to 30 times the face value of each Note therein, which is permissible under the Federal Reserve System.

I was able to get only {$24.00} restored to each card by working with U.S. Bank ( their records supposedly only go back one year ( XXXX x {$2.00} = {$24.00} ). I truly believe that the packaging of these particular gift cards is intended to be vague so that neither the donor or the recipient is aware that \\\" time is of the essence \\'\\'. I truly thought that the $ XXXX monthly deduction would begin after the first time I used the card at a retail register. I have other gift cards that I have received, and none of them have these harsh conditions ( you can be sure I looked closely at that after this event ). It is fine with me if MC and U.S. Bank want to run their business by eroding the value of a gift card ( for which they have received their money ), but I do think that they should have to make it clear ( and abundantly so ) that their gift cards are diminishing in value second by second, minute by minute. \\\" Use your card NOW or it could be worth very little or nothing in the near future \\'\\' should be emblazoned on the packaging.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"Recently Bank of America foreclosed on my families home ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) after they failed to follow through on a home modification ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). After my wife became unemployed due to a matter concerning our children we began to have difficulty making payments. The loan was acquired in XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and we began to have major difficulties in XX/XX/XXXX. We attempted in XX/XX/XXXX to get help right when we notified them of my wife \\'s unemployment, but were denied. We were told as long as we stay within 2 months of late payment were were fine so we kept making payments. Eventually we started to get foreclosure information from Bank of America and after applying for a modification two more times BOA agreed to a modification where we pay XXXX per month for a year to pay the past due balance for 3 months ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). Initially, we were only falling 2 months behind ( XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) before we were able to pay our regular payment, but they forced us into 3 month behind so they could create an agreement though technically we were only 2 months behind almost XXXX. After we successfully completed the agreement of 12 months from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( We never missed a payment on the modified payment plan agreement and followed the plan as stated XXXX in XXXX XX/XX/XXXX as scheduled we were to return to our normal regularly scheduled payments which were set to start XXXX XX/XX/XXXX according to the modification agreement we had signed a year earlier in XX/XX/XXXX. However, they did not allow us to return to our regularly scheduled payments, instead they demanded that we pay over XXXX the same month we were to start our payments back ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) saying we were past due and the home is in the foreclosure process. Each month they kept increasing what we owe. We could n\\'t understand how when we followed the agreement. BOA made us feel as if we did something wrong and said for us to keep applying for a modification to help with over XXXX past due bill. Eventually BOA stated we had to pay what was due on the loan about XXXX plus XXXX. We kept applying for assistance for modifications ( from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) and they denied us over and over even though my wife had gotten a job during the process and the income had increased some and we reported it. BOA kept sending us through a harsh application process and would misplace papers, not respond, etc. Finally, after they broke the contract agreement and wrongfully foreclosed on our home XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which forced us to hire an attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and we filed a suit against BOA in XXXX XXXX. We are a family of XXXX that includes XXXX children we have had to go through having random people for months show up at our home, people knocking on the door asking if we want to stay and they will buy the house, but we can pay them, which scared our children. People walking around our home during numerous times of the day and peering through out windows. The humility of having our home online under foreclosed homes for sale. Now the case have been in federal court for months ( XXXX, TX ) and BOA recently tried to negotiate with our attorney to have us get the loan back from them and start back make payments after they wrongfully took our deed by breaching a contract and wrongfully foreclosing on our home. BOA wishes to proceed as if they never violated a contract and wrongfully foreclosed on our home causing us to suffer mistreatment and expenses due to their actions. They know the contract stated for us to return to our normal payments, not submit any balloon payment. We would like assistance. BOA has mistreated us for a long time and they still are attempting to get away with mistreatment. We are not accepting such deal and would like to see consequences for their actions. They are not exercising good business practices. We would like immediate action to be taken against BOA.  \"\n",

I \\'ve paid every car payment on time, and XXXX and its collections agency should n\\'t be allowed to abuse the system and its customers.

Next thing I know, I receive a letter from a collections agency on behalf of XXXX XXXX. I called them finally to try to get to the bottom of the situation. Was told they received my requests for a detailed summary of charges and had mailed one out but I never received it. I then asked what the charges were for and the collection agency said for close out fees. Please note I was not on any type of contract with XXXX XXXX but on a month to month basis. I also informed the rep over the 5 years I was a XXXX XXXX customer, I never was notified of any close out fees on a month to month service basis. The rep then put me on hold and transferred me to a manager. The manager was rude, cut me off multiple times and said they will be reporting me to the credit bureau. How is this fair and is this not against the law? A consumer is asked to pay a debt blindly with no explanation of charges whatsoever, no response to multiple requests of a summary of charges and then told the fees are for close out service fees that I was never made aware of? Is this illegal? How is a consumer to protect themselves and their credit against companies like this? What can be done here to protect me, the consumer?  \"\n",

Without any notice, my online access to my Wells Fargo Account and to make Wells Fargo Mortgage payments online were suspended, and removed any access to make online payments. At this time, they also tampering with my Personal Wells Fargo Checking and Savings accounts, they continually change my access and suspend my Transfers page, between my Personal Savings and Checking account and make it inaccessible.  This problems have been happening for the last four months. The Wells Fargo Customer service people are constantly calling me from phone number XXXX. I made my payment today and I just received the most harassing combative telephone call from this Wells Fargo Customer service number. I informed him I wanted my Wells fargo Online access to make my mortgage payments available. This Wells Fargo Customer Service man informed me that I was on probation. I never knew the banks could re-write your original deed and include that you will be on probation if you bounce a check. Someone needs to clarify this. I re-iterated the importance of having my online access, due to not having transportation to physically go to the bank. I asked if there was someone I could complaint to, and he told me a \\\" No \\'\\'.  Once I do make my Wells Fargo Mortgage payments physically at the bank, this bank delays and does not post the payment until days later, after my numerous calls to post my payment. If I do not make the call to report my payment that I made, they will assign this payment as \\\" unapplied funds \\'\\'.  Wells Fargo Mortgage has made payments more difficult to accomplish. Cash deposited into my Wells Fargo bank account, was available immediately before the due date, however, Wells Fargo refused to accept those funds and would not allow me to transfer them from Cash effective immediately to the Mortgage account. Telephone calls to the Wells Fargo banking department and Mortgage department were unable to do transfers between the bank accounts, due to being blocked by Wells Fargo Mortgage.  Wells Fargo purposely refused features which allows for easy payments to be made and completed, therefore making the payment process extremely difficult in what I believe is an effort by the bank and Mortgage company to cause problems with payments on the Mortgage. Is there any Banking Authority that oversees these procedures properly. On top of all this, the Bank has charged me all the late fees and other fees, which I have paid. These should have no bearing on the restrictions or \\\" probation \\'\\' as WFM calls it. This is a Banking institution right? I bounce a check, an NSF fee is charged, and I pay, and business goes on. Late on making a payment, the bank charges a fees, I pay, and business goes on. But in this case, business did not go on, as it should have with WFM. Is there any help available that oversees this. Do I have any rights?. The Wells Fargo Customer Service man made me feel like I have no rights and no choice and this difficulty probationary times will continue?  \"\n",

       "         value: \"We closed on a refinance with XXXX XXXX Loans in XXXX 2015. ( XXXX XXXX ). Prior to the XXXX payment date XXXX sold our mortgage to LoanCare. My wife and I have been homeowners/mortgage consumers for over XXXX years and have never repeat never been late with mortgage payments. My opinion, following our efforts to have LoanCare properly credit our XXXX and XXXX payments, is that this organization would have to improve dramatically to be deemed incompetent.  We had not received ANY documentation from LoanCare prior to the first payments due date. XXXX had notified us, in writing, that they had sold the loan but no new loan numbers were provided. My wife made the payment using tne ONLY loan number we had at that time. It was, of course, the XXXX loan number. My wife scheduled the payment that was due XXXX XXXX, 2015 through a \\\" bill pay \\'\\' service with our bank that has never failed to work properly in the past. According to bank records, this check was cashed/deposited by LoanCare on XXXX XXXX, 2015. After multiple calls, with many people who have apparently been through no customer service training whatsoever, it was determined that our payment had been credited to an account carrying a LoanCare number that matched our XXXX refi loan number. Correcting this error would seem to be fairly straightforward however this has yet to occur. Both my wife and I, on separate occasions, have been assured that the problem was addressed AND that with new mortgages they will not report late payments for the first XXXX days. Upon returning from a business trip last evening, my mail contained XXXX notifications, both dated XXXX XXXX, that our loan was \\\" in default \\'\\' and action needed to be taken. As of this writing, we are XXXX days into trying to receive recognition for PAYMENTS ( XXXX ) that we have made, in good faith, to an organization that seems to be procedurally challenged. My concern is this : once the XXXX day period has passed will LoanCare begin to report my wife and I to Credit reporting companies and damage our FICO scores? The fact that we have dutifully made our scheduled payments and made repeated efforts to work with them to assure these payments are appropriately credited and reflected in their records but have yet to accomplish this, would make errantly reporting negative credit information a serious and unwarranted attack on my wife and I. Should this occur, and my wife \\'s or my own FICO scores be negatively impacted because of their flawed processes, I believe that it could expose them to serious liability.  \"\n",

The reason we have PMI in the XXXX place, is that my wife & I got buried in our house ( at that time ) in XXXX, which we bought at the top of the market in XXXX, XXXX. That + relocating cross country to XXXX + switching jobs to be closer to family put us in a financial bind which we \\'ve worked hard to dig out of. So, we did not have the 20 % down payment to put down on our current redidence in XXXX. We purchased our current home XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Both my wife & I have excellent credit. We were overjoyed to discover how the values in our neighborhood have sky-rocketed ( due in part to a brand new XXXX school ), but were told by R.C.S that we had to wait until we were in our home for XXXX years ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) before we could apply to lose the P.M.I. So, we did. I never thought I \\'d say that I found a company that makes XXXX \\'s customer service look good, but with R.C.S, that sad fact came to be. We have been writing letters & making phone calls since right before we hit the 2 year point of ownership in early XXXX ( almost 6 months now ). We paid {$470.00} to have an appraisal done, and then the \\\" R.C.S run-around \\'\\' started in earnest. Our house, after a XXXX errors ( including choice of comparables & year it was built, which triggered at least XXXX unsuitable comp ) was appraised at {$290000.00}. All we needed was an appraisal in the low XXXX \\'s to remove P.M.I completely. Had we not lost a small fortune with our house in XXXX and were we not shouldering the P.M.I to the tune of {$250.00} / month, his XXXX appraisal might have been good news. But our realtor quickly produced XXXX comps \\\" averaging \\'\\' {$320000.00}, which I forwarded to R.C.S. Then the exact same model home as ours, built a year apart from ours, located less than XXXX block away ... sold for {$330000.00} ... a full {$45000.00} more than the R.C.S appraiser appraised our house for!  The appraiser, XXXX XXXX, told me that he \\'d gladly reconsider with the new comps, but we needed to go through XXXX. When I followed up with him over a month after I \\'d re-submitted them to R.C.S, he told me he never even received the ( more accurate ) comps from R.C.S! Now R.C.S reps say that we have to pay another $ XXXX to have yet another appraisal done. Whatever happened to \\\" owning up to one \\'s own work ... or even mistakes \\'\\'?! XXXX of their managers, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, indicated to my wife that she would work with us ( over a month ago ) so we rushed down to the XXXX store and paid to have the ( accurate ) comps faxed to her personally ( even though R.C.S had had them since XXXX XXXX! But we believed her. Then ... no word at all from XXXX XXXX ... no return calls ... no response to several messages. I \\'m embarrassed as to how mad I \\'ve gotten talking to some of their representatives. All we want is a fair appraisal ( which we \\'ve already paid more than market rate for ) so we can write R.C.S a check ( if need be ) to meet the \\\" remaining \\'\\' required 80 % loan to value ratio, and to end our savings account being hit for {$250.00} every month ( for nothing ).  \"\n",

I clearly stated that I had not received any information from ALLY, and that intended to pay as soon as I knew all of the particulars. In the end, I made a payment over the phone and made it clear that I owed no late fees because of ALLY \\'s error. Since then, I periodically receive late fee notices that are now nearly the amount of a payment. I have written to dispute this error repeatedly and in XX/XX/XXXX checked my credit and ALLY has listed me as XXXX thirty days late on a payment. I have never been late on a payment and have it set up with my credit union to automatically pay ALLY every month on the XXXX. ALLY calls and tries to force me to use their check service for my payment which charges an additional fee, and I tell them repeatedly that my credit union does not charge me any fees and it is automatically deducted from my checking account. Now, I got a credit alert that ALLY has listed me as being late on XXXX payments! This is totally untrue and my credit score has dropped by XXXX points! I want the late fees removed from my account and my credit deleted of any late payments.  \"\n",

They did this to several people and you can google their names to read about the federal case. GMAC Mortgage was one of the mortgage lenders who gave me ( an XXXX year old working part time who claimed $ XXXX on her last tax returns ) a loan without properly verifying my identity or my ability to repay. After several years of fighting my case with both GMAC and the credit bureaus ( not to mention the thousands of dollars spent on my legal fees ) GMAC finally consented on XXXX XXXX, XXXX that this loan was not my responsibility and they would, \\\" have the credit reporting amended and remove your involvment with the loan servicing activities. \\\" Subsequently, they sold this loan to Ocwen Loan Servicing. Since then, I have been harrassed to pay off this debt. When I first discovered they were negatively reporting to the credit bureaus and mailing my parents threatening statements back in XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the company and provided them my current address as well as all the documentation from GMAC stating that I was n\\'t responsible for the mortgage. They removed the negative credit lines. Then in XX/XX/XXXX they started reporting negatively on my credit again. During this time period, they continued to mail statements to my parents address multiple times a year. Again, I contacted the comopany and provided my current last name, current address and verification that the trade line was n\\'t mine. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX Ocwen sent me a letter confirming that they acknowledge the loan is not my responsiblity. This letter was sent to my correct last name and address. However, to this day my parents are still forwarding me bills and insurance statements mailed to the incorrect name to the incorrect address. Besides the fact that they \\'re mailing personal information to the wrong address after being provided the correct one, I do n\\'t feel like I should still be receiving statements for this loan at all. It was not my responsiblity. I have nothing to do with this house or this loan. I was a victim of identity theft. It has been 11 years now and cost me thousands of dollars and I \\'m still fighting this because mortgage lenders were too greedy to properly verify income or ability to repay so they gave an XXXX year old college student hundeds of thousands of dollars in a mortgage.  I want my name to be removed from this loan file and I want any future correspondence to be mailed to the correct address.  \"\n",

I was told the statement closes on the XXXX of every month and I pay after that date. Whatever payment I make should go towards the statement after that date so long as it is paid after that statement closes. Their argument is a minimum payment amount has not been generated therefore the payment is not required to go towards the current statement.

Within a day or two after I filed my XXXX XXXX CFPB complaint regarding Bank of America I received a telephone call from XXXX XXXX XXXX of Bank of America. I was told that she was calling on behalf of Bank of America \\'s president as a result of my complaint to the CFPB.   We spoke on XXXX XXXX and at that time XXXX XXXX promised to finally correct my deceased Father \\'s mailing address, and to get a nearby branch manager to give me a call, so I would not be forced to repeat the frustrations of the past when I attempted to close my Father \\'s accounts at a local Bank of America branch. In addition, on XXXX XXXX I FAXed over to Bank of America a letter addressing concerns about unauthorized Bank of America deductions from XXXX of my Father \\'s account. XXXX XXXX had previously promised she would review these concerns.   I have called XXXX XXXX a number of times since I sent the FAX over on XXXX XXXX, and I have yet to hear from her. Neither, all these weeks later, have I received the promised call from the Bank of America branch manager.   Recently I received a letter from XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, which explains why she has failed to return my calls. In her XXXX XXXX letter XXXX XXXX incredibly absolves Bank of America from any part in my concerns not being resolved. Further, the letter disingenuously suggests I give her a call to \\\" discuss this further. \\'\\' I have yet to see a sign that Bank of America is interested in more than simply stonewalling me, and frustrating my lawful efforts to close my Father \\'s accounts. I am hoping CFPB can compel Bank of America to take my concerns seriously, and resolve matters promptly.  \"\n",

They directed me to Global Lending Services for the loan ( I had previously been with XXXX XXXX@4.9 % ). Since the purchase, I have had nothing but trouble. I had to cancel a {$1500.00} ( extra ) warranty that the dealership had told me I should buy. My last statement shows a repossession fee of {$100.00} added to my bill ( my car has not been repossessed ). In XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of {$XXXX} payment to catch up ; however, I requested a payment history summary from Global, and, the payment history shows I was credited with paying only {$XXXX}. At the beginning of the loan the pay-off was {$XXXX}. During the past year, I have made over {$7000.00} in payments, but my pay-off is still well over {$20000.00}. Global refuses to allow me to change my payment due date ( I have requested a new due date XXXX to help me make my payments on time ). I need help from somewhere.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"I am in the process of a XXXX short sale. I received the XXXX Short Sale notice in XXXX XXXX. From my understanding I had 120 days to receive an offer ; I in fact received XXXX within that time period. Unfortunately, the buyer walked. We now have another buyer as of XXXX, but the biggest issue we have had are the delays in the review and then the short postponement periods. This appears to be a Wells Fargo strategy to delay so it appears that I am at fault. In addition rather than place a Hold the XXXX XXXX, they postpone and then count it against me. Previously they were postponing for 30 days, now they are postponing for 60 days, but what is occurring is that by doing that, they count it against me and say that I may not get a postponement of sale on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, because I have had too many postponements. In my estimation it seems to be a ploy so that it appears as if I am not complying, but I have been. I have been submitting documents in a timely fashion. Most recently they tried to deny the current offer as they advised that I had not submitted the documents. Thankfully my agent had sent the offer documents via secure email and Wells Fargo was able to upload the documents into the system and review, but this was not an easy task and it was almost denied due to their ineptitude. Now Wells Fargo says that they may not be able to postpone the sale under XXXX because I have had too many postponements, again, that is something that the bank would be responsible for as they should have put the sale on Hold until this is resolved. My understanding also is that there is a one year limit while we are in the HAFA program. In addition, they are trying to put the modification process and the HAFA process together to count all of the postponements. Other ways that delays occurred were saying the BK atty authorization letter was not in the system yet they had been discussing the file with my agent and myself for a long time. So either they violated the law or they were using these tactics for delay purposes. In another instance, they wanted more than was approved on the XXXX Short Sale Notice, most recent, we spent almost a month and a half making corrections to the offer contract because of the address. The correct address as was notified to the lender did not include the word AREA, but we were asked to correct. XXXX was sent to clarify. I should not be penalized and have my home of almost 19 years now foreclosed due to delays on the bank \\'s part. The process has been very excruciating for me, as I wanted to keep my home but now I have to sell my home via a XXXX short sale. It has been a very excrucitating process as the sale dates are public knowledge, therefore, many investors who act like vultures knock at my door threatening me that the bank will foreclose and I need to get out. This has caused undue stress physically and emotionally. I understand I am behind on my payments, but I tried very hard to get the modification but I was denied! I now believe the delays have been deliberate to create a foreclosure situation for me. Please check into this situation so that I am allowed to finalize the XXXX Short Sale and prevent a foreclosure and allow me to have a dignified exit. This is a clear violation of the Homeowner \\'s Bill or Rights - dual tracking.  \"\n",

We contacted the bank about the excess contribution and they said we had to mail or fax a form for the refund and a {$15.00} fee would be charged and a refund would sent by check. We submitted the form and about a week later the account was debited for the over contributed amount plus interest and the fee was deducted from the account. We waited 10 days and did no receive a check. We contacted the bank and were told that a check had not yet been issued and contact them again at the end of the month if we did not receive the check because they were busy and can take up to thirty days to refund the money. Meanwhile no interest is being paid to us on the amount. They were not too busy to debit the account and charge a fee! A business practice to remove money from an account and the hold it for up to 30 days without interest seems unfair and poor treatment of their customers.  \"\n",

Or, dare I ask, receive some type of refund for paying such a high interest rate? In Oregon, there is a cap on how high of interest companies can charge on these types of loans. I did n\\'t realize I would be paying so much more than my initial loan amount. I have not approached them yet to inquire about this directly. Rather, I wanted to find out my options.

XXXX sent an unpaid bill to a collection agency, Health Services Asset Management for collection, despite us having verification issues with the debt.   Health Services Asset Management is telling us they no longer have the itemized statement from the creditor, and can not prove the details of the debt. They can only prove this debt is owed because a dollar amount was turned over by the original creditor.   We need proof of this debt. We had XXXX insurance companies, so there should not be as large of a balance, especially since the doctor providing service was an in network doctor on both plans, and our deductible had been met. We can not validate this bill based on the information Health Services Asset Management is giving us.   They have placed this item on our credit reports, and we stand to lose over {$7500.00} in earnest money on a house because of it.  \"\n",

This difference in exchange rate is not insignificant ( 1-3 % ) and appears to effectively be an undocumented fee. I experienced the following XXXX examples of this recently : On XXXX XXXX, 2015 a charge for {$40.00} XXXX was made by XXXX XXXX it posted on XXXX XXXX using the exchange rate XXXX resulting in a charge of {$32.00} United States Dollars ( USD ). This charge was in error, and a refund was issued immediately by the vendor for {$40.00} XXXX on XXXX XXXX, it posted on XXXX XXXX with an exchange rate of XXXX resulting in a refund of {$32.00} USDOn XXXX XXXX, 2015 a charge for {$180.00} XXXX XXXX Dollars ( XXXX ) was made by XXXX XXXX XXXX it posted on XXXX XXXX using the exchange rate XXXX resulting in a charge of {$130.00} USD. Part of this charge was in error, and a refund was issued immediately by the vendor for {$20.00} XXXX on XXXX XXXX, it posted on XXXX XXXX with an exchange rate of XXXX resulting in a refund of {$14.00}.   In the above XXXX exampled even though the return/refund/credit should have resulting in a net charge of {$0.00} USD, they did not - and in effect I was charged for the privilege of purchasing and returning an item. I have contacted Chase XXXX times to date without an adequate explanation for the use of XXXX different exchange rates. I am requesting an investigation by the CFPB if this practice is fair or deceptive. Thank you for your time regarding this matter.  \"\n",

The loan started as an interest only loan, XXXX Arm, which quickly increased in payments. We refinanced to what we thought was fixed only to learn it was another interest only loan with a XXXX Arm. When we tried to correct this Ocwen would not cooperate, instead they had someone else information on our file who was claiming to live in our home but in reality was trying to take the home from under us. It was then we went to a lawyer and had no other choice but to go the bankruptcy route. Even after all of this it is still not over, now what should have been a fixed 2.00 % apr, 30 year loan, if now increasing ( most recent XX/XX/XXXX ), and will increase again in XX/XX/XXXX to a 4.50 % apr, with the final payment being a balloon payment. This is the most discouraging of it all, because we would have been struggling for 30 years and still possibly lose the home is we do not have enough to cover the final payment. It has already been an 11 year struggle ... .and still no relief. We would love some assistance please as we are currently behind 3 months and now Ocwen is rejecting my monthly payments of {$1000.00}.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"Due to personal circumstances, I missed XXXX payment on my credit card in XXXX of XXXX, resulting in a late fee, which then resulted in an over-the-limit fee. Thereafter I continued making minimum payments for an additional 6 months. However, these payments did n\\'t affect the balance on the card due to being continually charged an over-the-limit fee. I tried speaking to the credit card company, but not only did the person I spoke to have very broken english, they also refused my requests to cancel or freeze the account to stop the continued rising of the bill, regardless of payments being made.  The only way to stop this from happening to the best of my knowledge at the time, was to stop making payments. Which I stopped making in XXXX of XXXX. I was then put into default.   I originally signed up with XXXX as the credit card provider in late XXXX, then the creditor was sold to Capitol One, and terms drastically changed and so did customer service. My card was reported stolen in XXXX of XXXX, so XXXX different accounts are represented via my credit report, however they are the same account. I also had 70 months of continuous on time payments with this credit card, with XXXX 30 day late, then another XXXX payments after.   With the company changing hands, I believe the fair service went with it. Due to this I was at a loss as to how to handle this situation with this company, and only today becoming aware about the ability to file this claim.   I \\'m also initiating this because of a judgment issued to me in what I believe is XXXX XXXX, shown via an online credit reporting website. I was never notified of this action or pending court date. I only became aware of this situation after I was given a letter by a seasonal employer, XXXX, which stated they would start to garnish my wages. I am no longer employed with this company, as this was seasonal work, and no garnishments were made. I then went to both credit reporting websites ; XXXX XXXX, and XXXX, in an attempt to find out what is happening. Both sites show that there was a default judgment in the amount of {$1600.00}. My credit limit was {$1300.00}.  \"\n",

When we saw the Wells Fargo answer, we reviewed the loan documents and discovered that when we refinanced back in XX/XX/XXXX they used the XXXX loan amount from XX/XX/XXXX as the home appraisal which presently differs of more than $ XXXX. In the other hand, we did not received the amortization schedule of the refinance, even if we have been asking for the document since the very beginning.   Now their letter stated that we have XXXX options : Option1 ; Send them a check with the difference to reach their 75 % and Option 2 ; Provide proof of the value of our home value which must be determined by having an appraisal done by them, or order a Brokers Price Opinion, ( BPO ), both options at our expense. In either case, the ultimate decision is theirs and we do not have any certainty the PMI will be removed.   We consider that the refinance process was managed improperly, based on incorrect very ambiguous and distracting information, so that guided us to take misleading decisions like the PMI not being discussed.

I was told many times that no XXXX XXXX mortgage payment would be needed. 6 days later, on Monday XXXX XXXX, an auto-pay for {$2400.00} was deducted from my checking acct, and applied to the closed loan. The unexpected payment made my checking acct overdraft by {$640.00}. The Loan Officer admitted his error ( that he never cancelled the auto-pay ), and he put in writing that I was due the principle and interest refund. He also said escrows from the closed loan would be refunded in 2-3 wks. On XXXX XXXX, {$2400.00} was wired to my checking acct. ( {$2400.00} is the total of all escrow money held in the closed loan ). The Loan Officer then stopped returning my calls and emails because he focuses on loans, not closings. In XXXX I had 3 meetings with Citizens Managers trying to get my principle and interest returned, but they said no money was owed. The Title Company Manager told me that this problem is common with Citizens-CCO, and that other closings that occurred at the end of the month resulted in customers who were trying to get their \\\" extra payment \\'\\' returned too. Then in XX/XX/XXXX the local Citizens people sent my issue up to the Office of the Chairman ( OOTC ) of Citizens Bank. Then I started receiving finance charges due to the overdraft that was caused by the Loan Officers negligence. I reluctantly paid the {$640.00} overdraft funds in order to stop the finance charges from occurring. The OOTC reviewed the situation and in XXXX they said no money is due back because they already sent me the {$2400.00} escrow money. Then in XXXX I supplied documentation again proving I was owed money for the extra payment of principle and interest. Then in XXXX the XXXX replied that they sent me the {$2400.00}, which they now claim was the principle and interest plus 1 days \\' worth of interest! So I have 2 letters from the OOTC which directly conflict with each other! If they ca n\\'t figure this out, who can? I wrote to them and asked them to tell me the correct answer because their letters say 2 totally different things, and for the last 2 months they refuse to look at the issue because they say they already addressed it. Frustrating! I have asked for a face to face meeting, I have asked repeatedly for a phone conference to go over the documents, I have great email trails, and documents to prove that money is owed to me. I have spent more than 100 hours working on this, to no avail. I have written nice letters, and I have more recently written stern letters XXXX but always respectful ), trying to get action. I have spoken to experts in the mortgage field that tell me to file a complaint with the CFPB to get action.  \"\n",

We are permitted to take a vehicle with us to XXXX. The company which ships the vehicles requires either a clear title, or a letter of approval from a vehicle lien older. Sometime in XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Ally Bank and requested a letter of authorization to ship my vehicle to XXXX. I was told they would not be providing me such a letter.   I purchased my vehicle back in XX/XX/XXXX. The total cost of my vehicle was over {$17000.00}. My vehicle is currently worth {$6000.00} and I currently owe approximately {$7000.00}. I do not have the funds available to immediately pay off the remaining balance. I have contacted other banks asking about refinancing the vehicle and was told they wo n\\'t do it because the value of the car is less than the amount still owed. I am current on all payments on my car loan. Although I was late making XXXX payments over the past four years, those payments were made very shortly after their due date.   Having a vehicle in XXXX would help my wife and children tremendously. If I am not allowed to ship my vehicle, I have no idea how or where I would store the vehicle for the three years we will be stationed in XXXX.   I do not have a copy of my financing agreement with Ally readily available, as nearly all of my personal belongings are packed up and ready to ship XXXX. Even if such a clause exists in their financing agreement prohibiting transporting vehicles outside the country, I believe such a clause would be unconscionable for military service members. I do n\\'t know if it is Ally \\'s policy to not provide any service member with this type of authorization letter, or if I am being singled out for some reason. Regardless, I would have never financed with Ally had I known they would deny me the ability to take my vehicle with me to an XXXX duty station. I am requesting any assistance available in obtaining an authorization letter to ship my vehicle.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"In XXXX of 2012 We had some financial issues and had to file for chapter XXXX bankruptcy. Immediately following our filing date, Ocwen did an escrow adjustment raising the amount of our monthly payment from {$480.00} to {$660.00}. They also at this time stopped sending us a monthly statement. When I talked to a representative they told me their system was down and were unable to send a statement at that time nor did they tell me of the rate increase. Being that we had just gotten all the necessary paperwork completed for the bankruptcy, we were under the assumption that all delinquent amounts were accounted for and set up in the payment plan to our trustee. After several months the bankruptcy attorney had informed me that Ocwen had still not responded to the claim from the trustees office and asked if I would contact them to see what was the matter. I contacted Ocwen a second time and was told they had not received a claim. I again asked about a monthly statement and was told again that their system was down and no one was getting a monthly statement. Soon after, the bankruptcy attorney contacted me again stating that Ocwen had filed the claim, however it was past the deadline and rejected by the trustee. I contacted Ocwen a third time and was told we needed to file for a modification and that the claim amount they filed was incorrect. They also informed me that we were now further behind in our payments. I told them we had been making our payments every month and they said they were not accepting the payments because they were only partial payments. This is when I became aware of the additional amount for escrow. I told them I was unaware of any increase because they had not been sending us a monthly statement. I inquired about the statements again and got the same response as the previous XXXX times. Time has gone by and we still have no resolve in the issue. The trustee has not made any payments to Ocwen, because they have no claim on file. Ocwen also failed to notify the trustee of my monthly payment increase. I have contacted Ocwen again and reapplied for a modification but was denied. I asked about monthly statements again and was told this time I needed to request them. So, because of Ocwen not following through the way they should have, and because of not getting any statements showing what was due, they are now showing us to be more than {$12000.00} behind our original amount past due which at time of filing was just over {$3800.00}. This has now placed approximately {$400.00} a month more towards our monthly expenses. {$170.00} towards our mortgage and an additional {$200.00} towards our trustee payment. We are trying very hard to make this right and to keep our home. However, we feel that Ocwen is doing everything they can to make this impossible.  \"\n",

If there is a radio button to initiate a response, I can not find it in your very pale pastel green links.    XXXX XXXX 2015Case number : XXXXXXXXConsumer Finance Protection BureauSpecialized Loan ServicingI was n\\'t surprised by SLS response to my complaint. Their knowledge and servicing of my HELOC falls far short of their fudicial responsibilities.   1. SLS lacked full knowledge of XXXX requirements from the onset.   2. Prior to XXXX XXXX, I rejected SLS \\'s offer to initiate an ACH.   3. I denied their fredom to share my Personal Information with unaffiliates.   4. I asseerted my intent to mail the \\'Total MonthlyPayment \\' as noted.   5. SLS has failed to identify the institution executing monthly ACH dmands.   6 SLS has refused to escalate my concerns beyond Executive Services.   7. SLS characterizes our direct monthly payments as \\'unapplied funds \\'.   8. We submitted timely payments posting on XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and with check # XXXX in the a mount of {$190.00} which SLS returned.   9. SLS checks # XXXX are unauthorized.   9. SLS has unnecessarily and adversely impacted our FICO scores.   10 SLS has failed to correct their lack of oversight and make us whole.    I formally request a TILA AUDIT on my HELOC contract in 2015 after SLS bought our loan. The attached documents clearly reveal our timely \\'Total Monthly Payments \\' accepted and processed electronically by SLS.   SLS asserts they are \\'only a Servicer \\' for the \\'Investors \\'\\'. SLS Agents express no knowledge regarding the ongoing ACH drafts in the amount of {$100.00} against our XXXX XXXX Checking Account. They have no access to view the actions of the \\'Cash Operations \\' division of Specialized Loan Servicing. They referred me to XXXX for resolution.   I failed to discover the originator of the ACH demands. Neither XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), XXXX, nor XXXX XXXX could discern the identity of the ACH Originator. None of the above financial institutions has record of my HELOC under either of our Social Security Numbers. A resolution is beyond our capabilities.   XXXX XXXX reversed XXXX ACH charges in question on XXXX/XXXX/15 for {$200.00} provisional credit, then XXXX more times on XXXX & XXXX for {$100.00} each. These Provisional Credits were for unauthorized drafts. We closed our XXXX XXXX checking account on XXXX/XXXX/15 to eliminate the unauthorized tapping of our funds. Specialized Loan Servicing and its assigns will attempt to process another ACH draft tomorrow.   Prior to XXXX/XXXX/15, the HELOC ACH payees appeared on our XXXX XXXX statement as XXXX, ATTN : XXXX \\'. Beginning with the XXXX XXXX draft, the payee was designated \\'Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC \\'.  to me, this indicates a change in ownership.   I received a copy of the original HELOC agreement with XXXX in XXXX indicating a minimum monthly payment of {$100.00} with XXXX. To resolve further contention with SLS, we posted a check on XXXX/XXXX/15 for the amount of {$190.00} to bring the loan current. That check was returned on XXXX.   Due to SLS \\'s reprehensiible and negligent actions. our FICO score dropped XXXX points. SLS \\'s untimely actions have jeaprodized my XXXX stated intent to them to refinance the HELOC and rid their influence from our lives.   As a consumer, I depend on financial institutions to provide me with timely and accurate information and interpretation of my financial commitments. SLS has failed in their fudicial responsibilities.   If will be prudent for Specialized Loan Servicing to act fudicially, ethically, and without delay to restore my credit rating AND reverse any penalties and additional interest charges levied since they assumed ownership of my HELOC.  \"\n",

The next month I realized that my payment was actually {$4.00} shy and I was charged a {$35.00} late fee!!!!!! I immediately contacted customer service to complain and was told that the late fee would be removed. That said, I made my normal payment on the due date and was charged ANOTHER late fee. Today, on XX/XX/XXXX after noticing that nothing has been corrected and that late payments are still being applied to this account, i paid {$35.00} as everything else is late fees that are continuously being applied to my account all over a payment that was MISTAKENLY {$4.00} shy. I had also requested months ago that my payments be due on the XXXX of each month, I believe that request only lasted for one month and now the payments are due on or about XXXX/XXXX of each month which is not what i requested at all. Lastly I want to make sure they WM is NOT reporting that I have been paying my account late to the credit agencies because that is not the case!!

We were adamant that we had sent the payment, but we had no bank records because we sent the payment in the form of a XXXX XXXX XXXX gram. We entered escalation at that point in an attempt to find the missing XXXX payment.  During the early escalation process we had several different representatives give us varying stories regarding which payment we were missing ( we were told it was XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ). We began to record the calls ( with the knowledge of the representatives ) because everybody was giving us different information. At first we were told we were missing XXXX payment and then we would be told that we were missing XXXX payments?  In XXXX of XXXX we requested and received an account ledger/audit that documented every payment since XXXX. It made NO sense. Not only were payments misapplied/missing, but our suspense account was missing money.  In XXXX of XXXX we decided to just make up the payment ( s ) that Ocwen said we were missing, which at the time we were told was XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. We did so because it was not worth the damaging credit reporting. In XXXX we sent XXXX payments ; XXXX for {$1800.00} ( the missing two months, according to ocwen ) and another for {$900.00} ( the current month payment ). Those payments should have brought us current as of XXXX XXXX.  In XXXX XXXX, we were still being documented as 90 days delinquent? I called Ocwen and began another escalation process.  At that time Ocwen stated that we were also missing XXXX XXXX payment ( which had never been brought to our attention before ). We were also told that our {$1800.00} check was returned along with the {$900.00} check from XXXX XXXX? We were told that they were returned NSF?  We printed out 2 years worth of bank statements showing that ALL payments had been made, none were returned and NO FUNDS were ever credited to our bank account by ocwen.  I have sent our records to ocwen on XXXX occasions showing that the:1. XXXX XXXX payment was made and received by Ocwen2. Both XXXX XXXX payments were paid and received by ocwen. ( {$1800.00} & {$900.00} ) 3. Ocwen never credited the {$900.00} check from XXXX XXXX back into our bank account in XXXX.   Our account should not only be current, but we should have a heafty suspense account balance. Ocwen has taken several payments from our suspense account to \\\" cover missing payments \\'\\' that were never actually missing. But even then, our monies are not being applied to the loan?  The short version of this story is that Ocwen lost a XXXX XXXX payment, we couldnt prove we paid it becasue we lost our money gram receipt. The we were told that we had mnissed XXXX XXXX payments ( XXXX and XXXX ), even though we knew that was no correct, we paid the XXXX missing payment plus the current mortgage payment in XXXX XXXX, and those payments were lost and/or not applied to the loan. Then after that they informed us that we were also missing a XXXX XXXX payment.  Attached are all the bank records showing that WE DID make those payments ( XXXX {$1800.00} and {$900.00} ; XXXX XXXX ) and Ocwen did receive the funds. If Ocwen missapplied or lost the money, that is not our problem. Our credit has been destroyed, we are being reported 90 days delinquent every month for the past 16 months. We have been in escalation 16 months, they have passed us around to XXXX different escalation managers and NOTHING has been fixed. Please help!  \"\n",

They received my payment of {$210.00} on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and a payment of {$1000.00} on XXXX/XXXX/2015 for a total payment of {$1200.00} ( more than the required payment amount ) therefore I do n\\'t understand how there could be a past due amount of {$240.00}? In the month of XXXX, they applied {$240.00} of my monthly payment to Escrow and the balance of {$960.00} to Unapplied Funds which caused all payments after the XXXX payment to be applied to Unapplied Funds. My escrow analysis said the shortage would be spread over 24 monthly payments beginning XXXX/XXXX/2015 therefore my XXXX payment should have been applied as billed ( {$200.00} principal / {$770.00} interest / {$190.00} escrow ). I \\'ve been in contact with many Ditech people via telephone during the past 5 months trying to get this corrected but my account continues to show as past due and I continue to receive collection calls.   I am tired of the harassing collection calls due to this error therefore I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your offices ( Ditech Financial ) to my home or to my place of employment.

       "         value: \"1 ) My wife and I refinanced our home loan through XXXX XXXX ( mortgage company ). Our NEW 30-year fixed rate conventional loan closed and funded during XX/XX/XXXX. Our new payment is {$230000.00} which includes {$160000.00} toward loan principal and interest plus an additional {$740.00} into escrow for payment of real estate taxes and our homeowners insurance. The XXXX mortgage payment was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX.   2 ) During XX/XX/XXXX, we received notices from both XXXX and ROUNDPOINT MORTGAGE of XXXX, XXXX indicating that our loan SERVICING had been assigned by XXXX to ROUNDPOINT and that we were to begin making our {$2300.00} payments to ROUNDPOIINT XX/XX/XXXX.   3 ) We then met our first three ( 3 ) mortgage payments due XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Everything was fine to this point. All funds were applied correctly to this point. Our XXXX quarter XXXX real estate taxes were paid as due!   4 ) With our {$2300.00} payment due XX/XX/XXXX paid on XX/XX/XXXX, we then received a ROUNDPOINT letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. This was an ESCROW ANALYSIS informing that our monthly payment amount was to be changed. The payment would be reduced from {$2300.00} to {$2200.00} because the {$140.00} portion of our escrow payment ( the homeowner insurance amount ) would no longer be collected in our payment. We soon received an escrow refund check from ROUNDPOINT in the amount of {$120.00}.  .  5 ) We contacted ROUNDPOINT and informed them of their error. They acknowledged! We were to continue making our payments at the original {$2300.00} amount 6 ) We paid our XX/XX/XXXX payment and all was fine to that point 7 ) We soon received another ESCROW ANALYSIS LETTER dated XX/XX/XXXX. This letter indicated that we had been paying {$590.00}. We always paid {$740.00} not just {$590.00} as this XX/XX/XXXX letter indicates. The XX/XX/XXXX letter indicate that our escrow payment is to be increased to {$740.00} from the current {$590.00} level. Now, please keep in mind that our required escrow payment has always been {$740.00}! Please keep in mind that we had always paid {$740.00}! Please recall that the {$590.00} amount only came about based on an error in the ROUNDPOINT LETTER of XX/XX/XXXX. {$590.00} had never been the only amount collected into escrow during our first 5-mortgage payments. Now, the ESCROW ANALYSIS process complicates matters worse! The escrow analysis concludes that since we are only paying {$590.00} into escrow all year ( not the {$740.00} we actually were paying ), we now have a projected {$1100.00} escrow balance shortage to make up. For this reason, there would be an extra {$92.00} collected in our new payment ion order to recover the escrow deficiency. Our payment would not be returned to {$2300.00} as it should have been all along, but rather, the new payment would have to be {$2400.00} which includes {$830.00} into escrow and not {$740.00} beginning XX/XX/XXXX.  8 ) Again we contact ROUNDPOINT CUSTOMER SERVICE and explain how they are screwing this loan up completely. This time, there is no success. They are convinced that after only having made XXXX-payments on our mortgage loan that we now have an escrow shortfall of & gt ; {$900.00}. They are refusing to back off on the {$2400.00} payment 9 ) We paid {$2300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX for that payment. We paid {$2400.00} ( extra escrow ) on XX/XX/XXXX as XX/XX/XXXX payment and now we have paid {$2400.00} on XX/XX/XXXX as the XX/XX/XXXX payment so as to not default even though the XXXX customer service personnel wont make the necessary corrections. I am convinced it is not because they want to be uncooperative. The problem is they dont understand what they did or how they did it.  10 ) I am now compelled to submit a RESPA Section 6 complain  \"\n",

The total amount of private loan debt that I had taken out during that time was {$26000.00} with XXXX. After school, I had difficulty making payments since the interest rate was variable ( although I was almost certain that I agreed to a fixed rate only ). To make the payments smaller, I had consolidated the private loan with a fixed rate of 10.50 %. The loan was eventually transferred over to Discover Student Loans and I am currently in good standing with them. The current loan balance is {$33000.00}, in which I have paid {$18000.00} in principal and interest to date. I have tried to refinance my loan with several institutions, but I am continually denied. The reason that is given to me is that I do n\\'t make enough money. I just had my XXXX child, and making these payments is extremely difficult. I would like to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I do not want to go into default, but I feel that I will be paying these loans forever unless I can get them refinanced to a reasonable rate. I do n\\'t know what to do. I have sought the advice of an attorney and an accountant - both who feel that I do n\\'t have any options except do very detrimental things to my credit and ultimately not be able work out a better deal for myself. I am desperately seeking advice on this! PLEASE HELP!  \"\n",

As you can see this is nowhere near what was sent to me in the mailing. He called me back several times trying to sell me on this. I told him I wanted to see it in writing and I know that is required to be sent after 3 days of receiving a quote which is what was done over the phone. This was XX/XX/XXXX that I requested this. The last conversation with XXXX he got real rude with me to the point when I told him I wanted to see it in writing that I hung up as this is poor business practice.

This loan is with XXXX and was a loan used to improve a house of which she has current ownership. Even though the payments are less than {$200.00} a month, she has not made them in a timely fashion. I realize that my name is still on the bank records for this loan, but my decree shows that this responsibility is hers and hers alone. The negative impact her continuing poor financial management is having on my credit score is unreasonable. I respectfully request that this entry is removed from my credit score.  Finally, I feel wrongly penalized for the credit inquiries I have had to request in pursuit of rehabbing my credit after divorce from my financially irresponsible ex-wife. How is a man who has served his country supposed to recover from the financial devastation wreaked by the person at home who was trusted to manage those finances if not by getting records and assessing damage? Please, is there any way to remove the negative rating these inquiries give me?  \"\n",

       "         value: \"I received a letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 that my mortgage had been sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY XXXX and the new servicer was XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX NJ XXXX XXXX. The letter indicates the loan was transferred on XXXX XXXX, 2015 but as of XXXX XXXX, 2015, the transfer of ownership had not been recorded in public records. I called the number, only automated service is available, no option to speak to a live person, and was informed my loan had been transferred to a new service provider, and to address any questions to the new service provider, but did not inform me of the name of the new service provider or the date of the transfer. As of XXXX XXXX, 2015, I have not received any notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX or from XXXX, XXXX that they are no longer the owners/service providers of my mortgage.   Meanwhile, I have received a letter from an entity \\\" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' ( self identified as a debt collector ) submitting a \\\" temporary mortgage statement \\'\\' asking me to pay them {$1700.00}. Nothing in the letter indicates my loan has been transferred or sold. I next received a generic note in a hand addressed envelope from XXXX XXXX ( again self-identified as a debt collector ) saying it had recently acquired the servicing of my loan. My name does not appear on the note, no dates are given, and no loan number is identified.   I called the number on the card and was told my loan was transferred to them on XXXX XXXX, 2015. As of XXXX XXXX, 2015, I have not received any statement from \\\" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' or anyone else indicating my loan was no longer at XXXX XXXX XXXX or from XXXX, XXXX.   According to the FTC website, I am entitled by law to receive within 15 days of any transfer, the following information from the new servicer : 1. the name and address of the new servicer 2. the date the current servicer will stop accepting your mortgage payments 3. the date the new servicer will begin accepting your mortgage payments 4. telephone numbers ( either toll-free or collect ), for the current and new mortgage servicer, for information about the transfer 5. whether you can continue any optional insurance, such as credit life or XXXX insurance ; what action you must take to maintain coverage ; and whether the insurance terms will change 6. a statement that the transfer will not affect any terms or conditions of your mortgage, except those directly related to the servicing of the loan. For example, if your contract says you were allowed to pay property taxes and insurance premiums on your own, the new servicer can not demand that you establish an escrow account.  7. a statement explaining your rights and what to do if you have a question or complaint about the servicing of your loan.   I have not received this information and am afraid THIS IS SOME SORT OF SCAM. When I requested the information from the person who answered the phone at \\\" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' she told me to contact my previous service provider ( presumably the one with only an automated phone system and no information ) and that any complaint I had was with the previous service provider.   There is a message on my telephone answering system from \\\" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' that states the call is for debt collection.   I have never missed or been late on a mortgage payment in 20 years.  In the past 20 years, whenever my mortgage has been sold or transferred, I received timely and complete notices, and automatic payments continued without interruption. The lack of professionalism and failure to provide information in this supposed \\\" transaction \\'\\' makes me very suspicious as to the legitimacy of the entities involved.   I BELIEVE THIS IS A SCAM IN PROGRESS.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"XX/XX/XXXX I lost my job and so did my husband. We were both making payments towards the house with no problems. As a result in my job loss my husband was the only provider and it became stressful and financially we were unable to make payments on our mortgage. I contacted the mortgage which was XXXX through XXXX XXXX XXXX. They tried to modify our loan and help us make lower payments. Then we got our result back and it was still high and we could n\\'t make payments. By the time we tried again to modify, my husband lost his job due to the company going out of business and we were left in a bad position. So I contacted the bank and asked to put the house on the market and that did not go well. Did n\\'t sell, then we went through a process of short-sale, deed-in-lieu and then I voluntary gave up the house and we moved out XX/XX/XXXX. We were given the run around by the bank every time we tried to get out of the house and the bank kept changing ownership through this order : XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Green Tree and now Ditech. Every time we get a process started we have to start over with another company. It has become very frustrating. We do n\\'t live in the house because my husband joined the XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and we live in California and are unable to make any payments on this house. We have been trying all these years to get the house out of our debt and always hit a stand still in our efforts. We ca n\\'t afford it and want something done. Please help us get the mortgage company moving on a outcome. We are no longer interested in keeping the home. Please fix the issue! We are very unhappy with the banks effort to help us! My husband wants to XXXX within the XXXX and because of the house our credit is a huge issue. He ca n\\'t have high security clearance because of the mortgage being a huge debt. We need to get the house off our credit so that we can pay off the small debt we have to establish a clean and well standing credit score.  \"\n",

I closed on my home through a VA XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, through Homestead Funding Corporation ( HFC ). HFC started using XXXX for servicing payments on my loan without notifying me in advance. I continued making payments on my mortgage. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received a call randomly asking me where I want my payments for my mortgage. The caller claims her name is \\\" XXXX \\'\\' and represents Homestead Funding Corporation. I voice that the call sounds like a phishing attempt as I have never received a call like this. XXXX threatens to return my payments without applying them to the loan. I voice my disagreement with her actions & voice my concerns that returning payments I have made on the loan without applying those payments to the mortgage sets a dangerous precedent. I asked to speak with XXXX \\'s supervisor, and she refused that request as well. I called XXXX later to confirm that my payments were being applied to the mortgage. A XXXX XXXX employee confirmed this information later that day. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received a letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) stating that my loan is being transferred from Homestead Funding Corporation. XXXX \\'s letter makes no mention of XXXX XXXX, leading me to believe it is a phishing attempt. Also, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I made a call to XXXX XXXX to discuss why a XXXX XXXX employee threatened to return payments and refused to get a supervisor on the phone during our call. The supervisor I spoke with confirmed \\\" XXXX \\'\\' made the call on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and confirmed he would review the XXXX XXXX phonecall. I asked what relationship XXXX has to XXXX. The supervisor confirmed that XXXX has a relationship to XXXX and confirmed that my loan was being transferred. I reminded the Supervisor that mortgage servicers are required to provide written notice at least 15 days before the effective date of the transfer. The supervisor retorted that the letters were sent out prior to the weekend and thus meet the 15 day requirement. The supervisor at XXXX did not have an answer for why I had received a notice of transfer from XXXX dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and yet XXXX failed to meet that 15 day deadline. In summary, my complaint names Homestead Funding Corporation, XXXX, and XXXX. My concern with XXXX is that my VA Loan is being set up to fail by a mortgage servicer with numerous complaints and XXXX ( XXXX ) star reviews on numerous websites. Finally, the pattern exhibited in my complaint consists of Homestead Funding Corporation and XXXX ignoring the laws set by RESPA and the FDCPA and failing to meet the requirements of providing written notice within the set timeframe.  \"\n",

Never got a closing date up to less than a week prior to required closing ( XXXX XXXX ) even though every request for information was satisfied within 24hrs of the request. Very Bad experience. Very poor communication. Despite request up front to let us know what was needed, the requests came in piece meal and often several times on the same documents.

CitiMortgage fails to respond to any and all of our requests for a loan modification. They also do not disclose the property sale date to us at all, we always have to find out via the local paper. Also, we have reviewed the original loan documents have found a real problem with the appraisal they did on our home. We refinanced the loan we had with Citi for a lower interest rate, the appraisal was inflated by {$47000.00} in only a span of 9 months. We feel this is predatory as Citi signed off on the appraisal which was done by the same appraiser who appraised our home for the previous loan.

She had payments scheduled in online banking to send to the Best Buy Credit Card. The scheduled payments must have expired because I got a call in XXXX, XXXX and XXXX by a computer telling me that the monthly payment was missed and offered to take a payment using my checking account information. I called customer service tonight and spoke to a very nice lady who took full payment at my request and also offered to remove the most recent monthly late fee. I asked for an explanation of the total interest paid in 2015 of {$1200.00} when my pay-off was only {$1500.00}. She told me about the XXXX and XXXX interest charges of {$670.00} and {$380.00} respectively. From my perspective, those quietly appeared without warning. And when she explained that the 27.99 % APR was on the initial purchase price calculated daily going back 24 months and not on the remaining daily balance, I felt that it was excessive. I respectfully asked for her use XXXX that rate. She put me on hold to ask a credit manager and the answer came back as no. She was so sweet and helpful that it was hard for her to tell me no. I asked if the credit manager would reduce the interest by XXXX and she said she was already told no to any relief. The reason she gave is that I had not tried to contact them sooner. If I had contacted them in the month following the interest charge, they may have removed it completely. But since it was 3 months after the charge, it would all stay. My frustration is that my wife pays our monthly bills and I knew something was wrong when I got a phone call. If they had used a person instead of a computer to call me for the recent missed payment, maybe I could have asked at that time. But I did n\\'t know about the excessive interest charges until I opened the XXXX statement today. If the computer that called me to collect my missed monthly payment told me that it included 77.53 % interest and 22.47 % principle and fees, I might have asked to speak with someone instead of just paying the requested payment of {$440.00}. Remember that these were gifts to me from my wife. Anyone who is married would recommend that I just pay the requested amount from the phone call instead of asking to see my wife \\'s accounting records. After the second monthly phone call from Best Buy Credit, I had to risk rocking the family boat and ask her. I survived and when the next bill came in the mail, it was laid out on the counter for me. That was last night. She was still paying the amount she originally scheduled, but it was no longer meeting the minimum because of the gigantic interest charge on what was then a small balance. I think that my call to Best Buy Credit today could still be considered timely since it was the first bill that came after XXXX phone calls from their computer. We did n\\'t miss any payments. It was the accumulated interest that caused required adjustments that my wife did not make any. I reacted after XXXX months in a row of notice that something was not right. I only asked that the interest charges be reduced to something both I and the phone representative thought fair. But I got a cold NO. The credit manager had the power to give a crumb at least. But nothing. It will cause me to not shop at Best Buy any more because it cost almost as much as the original gift and we never missed a single payment. The computer that called should tell us that our recent payment was not enough or we should get a special, separate notice that our balance doubled due to interest. Especially when they say NO because I called 3 months later instead of XXXX or XXXX. Cold-hearted.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"Around XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX, I banked with Wells Fargo in XXXX, Az. I had checking, savings, and credit card accounts. I was a college student and my tuition status changed from out-of-state to in-state and so the amount of my financial aid checks significantly increased. At this time, I thought it would be a good idea to try to build credit history by putting a number of charges on my credit card and then paying it down when I received my next financial aid check.  However, XXXX semester, after I had made a large payment from my checking or savings account to my credit card account, I noticed there was still a lot of money in my checking or savings account. I went to the Wells Fargo at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, AZ XXXX and asked a bank representative where this money came from. I was told that since I had made a credit card payment that far exceeded the minimum payment, some of my payment was put back into my checking or savings account. I did not complain or ask that it be reapplied to my credit card account.  At the time, I was not aware that cash advances carried a larger APR than purchases. It was some time afterwards that I realized this and recalled this incident. In XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX, I began requesting from Wells Fargo credit card and bank statements from that time period around XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I do not recall exactly when the incident had taken place and, after examining the statements, I still could not narrow down when this cash advance had taken place. At this point, I had been paying interest on hundreds of dollars of cash advances.  It was around this time that I noticed that my credit card statement no longer showed a balance for cash advances. To this day, I have a XXXX balance for cash advances.  I have been hesitant to bring up the whole issue with Wells Fargo for fear that the cash advance balance will return to my credit card. I do not know how much interest I paid over the years for the cash advance balance so I do not have a dollar amount that I am looking for in compensation.  Also, Wells Fargo has asked a number of times if I would like to close the credit card account and open up a line of credit at a lower APR. I have been hesitant to do this as well, as I am unsure if that will erase any records of all this.  Like I stated above, there is not a dollar amount that I am looking to be compensated. My intention in writing this is to inform a regulatory or consumer protection agency of this incident, in case it has happened in the past or is still occurring, and to find out if, by closing my credit card account and opening up a line of credit, it will somehow erase a record of these issues.  \"\n",

He also advised that my escrow refund has not yet been processed. I explained that my understanding is that the law requires that escrow refunds be mailed no later than 30 days after pay off. XXXX said that I would need to speak with someone in the escrow department and that he would transfer me. After over 20 minutes on hold, a representative named XXXX picked up but was apparently having phone problems and could not hear me. I called back and searched through the menus for the escrow department. After another 30 minutes on hold, I hung up in frustation.

The representative on the phone gathered information and processed the request, letting is know we had a small payment of XXXX due on XXXX XXXX and no payment due on XXXX XXXX and a final small payment due on XXXX XXXX if XXXX. After that our payments would return back to normal for XXXX XXXX. They advised us we would receive paperwork in the mail. On XXXX XXXX I called them back because we have n\\'t received paperwork yet and they also had on their website a payment still due even though we made a payment based on information above from our call on XXXX XXXX. The representative advised that the original request was not completed on XXXX XXXX and apologized and advised they will complete it again and since we already made our payment for XXXX XXXX out next payment was n\\'t due until XXXX XXXX of XXXX. We said ok and awaited paperwork again. We did not receive any paperwork againI received a number of calls from a collection agency and I returned their call on XXXX XXXX at XXXX and requested a supervisor and was transferred to XXXX XXXX at ext XXXX, to find out that neither of these above extension requests were ever processed. I was advised AGAIN that they would complete the extension and apologized for the mistake. I was told on XXXX XXXX by XXXX that the customer service department did have noted on the account where they were supposed to complete the extension but never did. She apologized again and handled the extension.   At this point we have 2 months being reported as delinquent on my and my wife \\'s credit for XXXX different credit agencies. XXXX apologized but said there was nothing she can do to rectify that and I would have to do this on my own.   I called back today XXXX XXXX to find out what Ally would do to rectify them reporting in accurate information on my credit and was advised that I need to take it up with the agencies again. I advised them, this was not my fault why should I have to do the leg work. I asked the representative today about the notes in their system snd she was able to read each note that was written by XXXX ally financial reps during above dates and I requested copies of these notes and was told I need a subpeana to get them. She Advised it was in their system but they could not provide it to me.   I \\'m being penalized on my credit by ALLY FINANCIALS NEGLAGENCE! Please help me get this resolved. I do n\\'t have any documentation since they will not provide it to me but they have advised their notes are in their system for internal use and will still be there for others to pull up.   My credit took a huge drop because of the delinquency being reported and I would like the delinquencies removed off ASAP.

       "         value: \"Our mortgage lender Wells Fargo has refused to work with us regarding modifying or refinancing our mortgage. We recently sent in a request for either a loan modification, refinance, or a principal reduction due to the fact that my husband has taken a pay cut with his company in order to retain his job and we wanted to take advantage of the all time low interest rates for a lower payment and not have a interest only payment but include some principal so it is getting paid down. We have been denied at every step with Wells Fargo and it has taken from XXXX to XXXX to get a refusal. Wells Fargo did completed a temporary loan modification with us on XX/XX/XXXX with a interest only loan for XXXX years and a lower interest rate but it steps up the interest rate each year until XX/XX/XXXX where the interest rate will cap at XXXX, then will re-adjust the payment to include principal and interest. We also have a balloon payment due of {$26000.00}, that was added to the mortgage for attorney fees, late fees, and other fees by Wells Fargo because of the modification and we are not quite sure when that balloon payment is due. We now currently owe {$520000.00} on our mortgage. They did lower the interest rate to reduce the payment but we think we are worse off now then before. The recent appraisal that Wells Fargo completed in XX/XX/XXXX the house appraised for {$440000.00}. We have contacted the XXXX XXXX Financial Counselor ) to help with trying to get Wells Fargo to work with us but they have not been able to achieve any results either. We have contacted other lenders to see if we could get our mortgage refinanced but because we are underwater they can not work with us.  The reason Wells Fargo states that they can not do anything with out loan is because they only service the loan and can not contractual make any changes to it. The loan is owned by XXXX Bank and research shows that it belongs to Wells Fargo Bank.  \"\n",

After becoming a victim of the identity theft and bearing the damages associated with the theft, which literally turned my life upside down, I took the opportunity to research and report numerous security flaws within the systems operated by Scottrade and their affiliates. Scottrade and their affiliates ignored my warnings and chose to retaliate against me for blowing the whistle and subsequently refused to honor their \\\" Online Security Guarantee \\'\\'. The issue of Scottrade and their affiliates apologizing and returning the money that was stolen as a result of hacks as well as compensation for damages has been in dispute ever since.  Now, over two years later, Scottrade and their affiliates has admitted that their security measures were not only insufficient, but Scottrade and their affiliates were largely aware of failed security measures and also aware that at least XXXX XXXX customers had their personal information compromised. ( XXXX ) ( XXXX ) I am writing to Scottrade and their affiliates today to gain additional insight into these events and better understand the risks of identity theft and how I can protect myself from further damages, specifically, I would request answers to the following questions:1. ) Does Scottrade or Scottrade Bank store personal information on computers owned and operated by Scottrade?  2. ) Which cyber forensics firm did Scottrade and/or their affiliates hire to investigate the breach?  3. ) What was the date of the first contact by law enforcement officials informing Scottrade of these attacks?  4. ) Was any of my personal account information, relating to account XXXX exfiltrated in the breach?  5. ) Was any of my personal account information, relating to account XXXX accessible by anybody internally or externally as a result of the vulnerabilities and and activities described in the press release referenced above?  6. ) Did Scottrade and their affiliates request permission from me to share my personal account information with a cybersecurity forensics firm?  7. ) What personal data is encrypted and what data is not encrypted?  8. ) Are Social Security Numbers encrypted at rest, in transit, and during use?  9. ) Are passwords encrypted at rest, in transit, and during use?  10. ) What encryption algorithm does Scottrade and their affiliates use for Social Security Numbers and/or passwords?  11. ) Scottrade collects data through a third party affiliate, which markets a product called \\\" XXXX \\'\\' which Scottrade markets as \\\" multi-factor \\'\\' authentication, was the \\\" XXXX \\'\\' system at all compromised?  12. ) Is information stored within the \\\" XXXX \\'\\' system encrypted, at rest, during transit, and during use?  13. ) Does Scottrade and their affiliates have any plans to implement \\\" out of band \\'\\' XXXX factor authentication?  14. ) Has Scottrade confirmed 100 % that no encrypted passwords or Social Security Numbers were accessed, viewed, copied, changed, or exfiltrated.  15. ) Was any of my account information, relating to account XXXX exfiltrated in the breach?

I turned the Hummer in early ( 3 months ) at the request of the dealership as they told me GMAC ( purchased by Ally ) had a promotion where I could terminate the lease early as long as I was purchasing another vehicle financed by GMAC. This is what I did. It appears the dealership never turned in the proper paperwork. It took me 2 years to straighten out as the GM who handled the deal, had left the dealership. They finally admitted their error and paid off the remaining outstanding balance.However Ally has reported this transaction to the credit bureau as late and a write-off which is just not the case. This reporting has had an adverse effect on my credit rating and has impacted my line of credit.  \"\n",

I have ask caliber on several occasions via letter over the last 3 months to please correct this or provide me with proof disputing my payment history from my bank. Their only response has been a predetermined letter stating according to our records this account is reporting correctly. There has never once been any written proof and or documentation provided by caliber to dispute my claim or substantiate theirs just that letter. I believe this to be a predatory lending tactic to prevent patrons from leaving a poorly represented company by lowering its consumers credit ratings. As previously stated there has been a biweekly payment sent to caliber home loans on my account since XX/XX/2014 to present. There is no way my account could have ever been 60 days past due let alone 30 days with biweekly payments being made every two weeks for nearly 2 years consecutively. ( I have documented proof ). Caliber accounting department has held payments and applied two payments at the same time and reported my account as being late. I have documentation of the cancelled checks with the date they were cashed by caliber home loans. This information was supplied to both caliber home loans and all the credit reporting agencies and caliber is still reporting false information and refusing to change it.  \"\n",

If your allowing them to simply get away with this please send me the next steps to pursue legal action this is n\\'t right not XXXX time have they sent me anything back verifying the lien. Also I sent them letters asking them to remove the closed accounts on my report that have been there over 7 years and nothing has been done. This is clearly criminal action I want these items removed immediately or I will take further action. The tax lien case will be easy Equifax said they verified the info yet the number they said they called is disconnected and has been for over 6 years. If Equifax is going to continue to lie to me I will certainly use this document when I file charges against them. I have been asking them for over 8 months now.  \"\n",

I have copies of my faxed documentation that proves that I sent all requested valid information several times prior to XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I was also told by Wells Fargo that their investor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX does not provide HAMP assistance. First Wells Fargo told me their investor does not approve or work with HAMP. Then Wells Fargo later told me I did not provide them with valid documents. I have since lost my home to foreclosure sale on XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo did not bid my home which had a fair market value of {$450000.00} at fair market value. They started the bid at {$210000.00} which sold for {$260000.00} because the investor bidding on my home knew it was worth much more than the winning bid of {$260000.00}. Now I am out {$180000.00} of equity because Wells Fargo did not bid my former home at \\\" Fair Market Value \\'\\'.   I truly believe that I was discriminated against on my HAMP and loan modification request by Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. At the time of my loan modification request I was able to get out of underemployment and had landed a new job that gave me enough income to start paying my mortgage payments again if a modification plan could have been worked out. I sent Wells Fargo all my pay stubs from my new job as well as all my bank statement information. Once I told them I have the funds to start making mortgage payments again I was told by by the home preservation specialist that they could not validate my income, even after I send them pay stub information, copies of recent bank account statements and all the other income information they requested. I worked extremely hard to save my home. I got behind on my mortgage payments due to underemployment. I had been a Wells Fargo customer since XXXX on the home they recently foreclosed on. Wells Fargo did not loose one cent of money on my foreclosed property. They made {$550000.00} on my home, {$280000.00} on 15 years worth of payments and another {$260000.00} at the foreclosure sale. Wells Fargo also held the XXXX mortgage on my home and requested the Over Bid proceeds of {$53000.00} on my foreclosed home. Wells Fargo sent me in writing that my homes market value was {$320000.00} prior to taking my former home to foreclosure sale. They knew they could get all the money owed to them if they would have placed a fair market value on my home prior to the foreclosure sale.   I truly feel that a huge injustice has taken place in the non-approval of my HAMP and Loan Modification Request. I should have been a candidate for being approved for either program. Since XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo has made over {$850000.00} off of my hard work. I paid a mortgage in full in XX/XX/XXXX on another mortgage I once had with Wells Fargo. Now 16 years of making mortgage payments is all gone. I have lost everything I have ever worked for because Wells Fargo continually came of with invalid reasons why I was not approved for a loan modification of approved for the HAMP program. I have paid Wells Fargo over {$850000.00} and now my home has been lost to foreclosure, all because of their discriminatory loan modification denial. Why would they not work with a long time loyal customer who needed temporary assistance. I have the all the paperwork to prove that I should have been approved for a loan modification plan. I was at Wells Fargo mercy and they deliberately decided not to approve my loan modification because of discrimination and greed. This injustice in pure evil and greed at work. I hope you can help me stop Wells Fargo doing this to other long time customers.   Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo Loan # XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  \"\n",

The way the advertisement is presented and the timing of the presentation make it seem like a required part of the process of placing a fraud alert on file.   Background is as follows. On XXXX/XXXX/15 I called TransUnion to place a fraud alert on my credit file. ( I had just learned my social security number had been stolen and someone was using it. ) I went through TransUnion \\'s prompts on initiating the fraud alert.   Then, before TransUnion \\'s automated system said the fraud alert was placed, it played an advertisement for paid credit-monitoring services provided by TransUnion. This ad was about XXXX seconds long and followed by a choice to press \\\" XXXX \\'\\' and order the service or press \\\" XXXX \\'\\' and decline the service. I pressed \\\" XXXX. \\'\\' TransUnion immediately played a XXXX advertisement for the same service, this time XXXX seconds in length and using much more alarming language, again encouraging me to pay for the service. Again I was presented with the choice to press \\\" XXXX \\'\\' to order the service or \\\" XXXX \\'\\' decline it. I pressed \\\" XXXX. \\\" Only after I declined the service XXXX did TransUnion \\'s automated system state that my request to place a fraud alert on file was successful.   TransUnion should not be able to require victims of identity theft to listen to TransUnion \\'s paid advertisements as the price for placing a fraud alert on their own files. But that is exactly what TransUnion is doing right now.  \"\n",

I was a XXXX 15 years ( including use of a XXXX ), XXXX. So I know the Fair Debt and Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), XXXX.

The determination that I am not \\\" XXXX enough \\'\\' and being unwilling to give me the opportunity to submit the XXXX portion of my XXXX does not seem legal or ethical ( Social Security used both XXXX ).   Why is the relationship between Navient and XXXX not investigated for collusion and a way to defraud the XXXX?   Why am I not permitted to submit the secondary XXXX diagnosis?   I posted a breach in FDCPA to the Consumer Affairs site, and read how individuals with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX were all denied by XXXX paving the way for Navient to collect debts from individuals that are otherwise considered XXXX by federal and state entities. Please check into this inequity.   Paying Navient even if state and federal review deem us \\\" unable to work \\'\\' is unreasonable when their \\\" contracted \\'\\' \\\" determining entity \\'\\' may gain financially by denying XXXX claims. In addition, when their staff refuses to send the appropriate form to XXXX individuals, it is basically an admission that they will not consider my XXXX claim anyway.  \"\n",

Bank of America illegally charged me a minimum interest charge of {$1.00} on the active dispute amount. They have since agreed to rescind the charge.  I am writing to bring your attention to the illegal interest billing practices actively in Bank of America \\'s billing system.  I am certain that numerous Bank of America customers have been illegally charged interest amounts on active dispute amounts.

I opened an XXXX account for my minor daughter so that she would have access to limited funds on a debit card. The card and the account were used sparingly. When my daughter attempted to make a teller cash withdrawal on XXXX XXXX, 2015, she and I were advised by bank staff that our account was overdrawn in the amount of {$1800.00}. We subsequently learned that my daughter was unaware that she had lost the debit card and that XXXX counterfeit checks were deposited to the account. Whomever perpetrated this fraud capitalized on the fact that immediate credit was provided by TD at the time of deposit. ATM withdrawals were then executed against the account over a 12 day span. Once we were aware that the card had been lost and the account compromised, we filed an unauthorized electronic transaction claim with TD. At the request of bank investigator \\'s, a police report was filed with the XXXX XXXX Police Department.   In explicably, TD Bank has denied our claim, citing as the basis for its decision, the fact that no additional transactions were attempted after the checks deposited were returned as counterfeits and because the transactions were consistent with our normal usage pattern. XXXX \\'s actions in this matter are a flagrant violation of Reg E and raise a question as to whether it \\'s policies in this area are in conformance with the requirements of the regulation. How many other consumers have been unfairly treated as my daughter and I have been?   I want to emphasize that the unauthorized transactions were all conducted in XXXX, NJ. My daughter and I reside in XXXX, XXXX, New York. Neither of us has ever recorded a bank transaction in XXXX, nor did we transact in the amounts and frequency noted for the fraudulent transactions. Moreover, there is no significance of the fact that unauthorized activity on the account ceased after there were no longer available funds.   Reg E requires that a financial institution have evidence that a covered transaction or transactions which form the basis of a consumer claim were not unauthorized if it is to deny the call for reimbursement. TD Bank has no such evidence and the inaccurate and absurd reasons it offers to unlawfully deny my claim is behavior that warrants an examination by the CFPB.  \"\n",

A week prior to meeting my husband, in XXXX XXXX, I closed on my XXXX house in up-state XXXX. I then went on a blind-date with my ( now ) husband and he XXXX move to XXXX XXXX, XXXX shortly after. We made the move across country in XXXX XXXX and I chose to become a landlord as I thought I could successfully rent my property with help of a property manager. The XXXX property management team was able to secure a renter for two years. However, at the end of that two year period we found out that the property manager had been lying to us and stole money from us that he stated were for repairs. The tenant moved out and we changed property management companies. The next one was unfortunately not much better and she continues to \\\" bully \\'\\' us when asked why she is not even listing our house on her own website. We listed the property for sale in XXXX XXXX and received XXXX different offers but the buyers could not secure their own loan. In XXXX XXXX my husband XXXX. I called Bank of America ( our lender ) and stated that I would not be able to pay the mortgage as we could not sustain XXXX separate households. Bank of America had me jump through the usual hoops by completing financial paperwork showing that we just could not afford the XXXX house. Bank of America requested for an appraisal which showed that I owed less than the house is worth so they would not approve a short sale. I then asked for a Deed in Lieu but was denied as we had not lived in the house in the last 18 months which is a requirement for Deed in Lieu. In XXXX XXXX, when my husband XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that I would need to wait for the foreclosure to proceed and that I was out of options. Despite my best efforts of continuously calling Bank of America and begging for some type of movement, regardless if it is a short sale, deed in lieu, or foreclosure, I have still have not received any assistance and continue to pay the utility bills for this vacant house. I have even gone so far as to reach out to the C.E.O. of Bank of America who reads my emails ( read receipt through Outlook ) but refuses to even reach out to me or give me guidance where to go. My husband has now XXXX moving us to XXXX XXXX, XXXX and although we continue to move about this house is still leaving us with quite the heavy burden. My husband and I already go through enough with military requirements and separations and this house is standing in our way from truly feeling free. Thank you so much for your time and I hope you respond as I feel terrified that we have run out of options. Please help my husband I get out from under this burden!   Sincerely, XXXX XXXX  \"\n",

As a XXXX, I am deeply concerned with Discovers inability or desire to offer help when consumers are struggling with repayments terms as a result of financial difficulty.   I attended XXXX XXXX XXXX College/University XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. During that time, my mom did what she could to put me through school, which included taking out private loans through Discover. While the terms of the loan were disclosed in the papers, granted she may not have understood 100 % ( Which is also a concern as the aid officers are sales people that need paying students for their success and sustainability, and how the terms are explained needs to be investigated at as well ) as she was doing everything she couldan to help me., that is not the issue. I certainly had no idea what I was getting into as the details were never explained to me. Coming out of college, I was fortunate enough to obtain a job as a XXXX, helping people every day with their finances, which makes this a little more ironic, as I see every day how Student Loan debt is crushing consumers.   The payments requested by Discover once the loan came due were $ XXXX/month. Obviously, I quickly turned to them for helped and used forbearance on my loans for six ( 6 ) months. That time has come and gone with no internal solutions created by Discover to help me through a difficult situation. They at times seem judgmental as to my efforts to secure more income, ask me to turn to my mom the cosigner to make the payments, not knowing or caring what financial difficulties she might be having, and repeating the same options to me every month I call, ignoring any pleas that I have made for help or assistance to offer terms I could afford. My student loan counselor/XXXX and I have called Discover every month like clockwork to see if there \\'s anything that can be done. All they offer is forbearance, which I only have 12 months available for the life of the loan, of which 6 months have already been used, interest only plans ( still close to $ XXXX/month ), going to my co-signer who is overextended in her own right. They have the audacity to say they \\'re here to help, said they \\'re glad to see I received assistance on my federal loans, but turn around and do nothing to try and help. We \\'ve offered a plan that fits my means multiple times only to hear \\\" no, no, no \\'\\' from Discover. It is crystal clear that Discover has no desire, policy, procedure or aid to help borrowers that have limited income.   Understanding how this industry works, it \\'s easy to see that as I continue to not makingbe unable to make payments ( {$4400.00} past due as I \\'m writing this ) that it will go to charge-off, collections, lawyers, court, etc. If it reaches a garnishment stage, I am aware that a certain number can only be taken, which is the number we \\'re willing to work on and offer monthly now, but Discover has no desire to consider this offer, even though that is where this will go if they can not work within what I can afford.to no avail Please help!!!

Then in XXXX of XXXX we got in the mail a notice saying that it was the final notice that our house was being foreclosed on by Green Tree. This was the XXXX time we had heard of anything like this about a foreclosure. We had been late on the mortgage a couple of months, but we had n\\'t received anything before this that said foreclosure. When we got the attached notice, we immediately filled out the papers that were attached to it that said we could get Assistance Modification. We faxed the modification paperwork to the number on the notice. After the modification paperwork was submitted, XXXX from Greentree said to send in {$900.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. But the cashier \\'s check we sent was returned to us by the mail saying it they were no longer at that address. We called XXXX back and he said to mail it to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX instead. We did n\\'t trust the mail, so we started bringing the money orders in person to this office building each month.  We took a money order to them each month and received a receipt. Because we were paying them each month and had gotten a receipt for our payments, we thought the foreclosure was taken care of and that our loan had been modified and was being held by Greentree. We were told to make our money orders out to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.  Then on XX/XX/2015 we received court papers saying that we had to report to the Justice of the Peace in XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015 for a foreclosure hearing. We got the name of a lawyer from a friend as someone who works with foreclosures. We hired XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX. We called him to try to hire him to come to our hearing on XXXX XXXX, but he said that was n\\'t enough notice for him to make it to the hearing, so we went to the XXXX XXXX hearing in XXXX alone. The judge asked if we had a lawyer and we told him our lawyer could n\\'t make it to the hearing, so he rescheduled our hearing for the following week. So then we paid him {$2500.00} in fees and he showed up for the next hearing around XXXX XXXX or XXXX. The lawyer did come to this hearing, but the judge said that he had only been on this bench a week, so he could n\\'t make a ruling, so he was going to transfer it to a higher court, to XXXX XXXX.  Our XXXX hearing in the XXXX court was on XXXX XXXX. Our lawyer did n\\'t show up, so the judge said that the court did n\\'t inform the lawyer of the change in court date, so they rescheduled it for XXXX. When we went to the XXXX court date, our lawyer showed up, but he would n\\'t allow our translator to come into the court.  At that court hearing, our lawyer told the judge that we did n\\'t speak very good XXXX, but that he would make us understand. Our lawyer asked me only XXXX question \\\" Were you making payments on the house? \\'\\' We told him we had been paying every month until we received the notice in XXXX saying that our house had been foreclosed on. After that, they did n\\'t ask us any questions, the judge just ruled for the XXXX XXXX that he owned the house.  After this, we asked our lawyer to appeal, but he said he would n\\'t do that, that we needed to hire another lawyer. He did not mention anything about us needing to pay a fee for an appeal. A week later on the XXXX of XXXX, we got a notice on our front door saying we had to vacate the house. We tried to call our lawyer, but he would n\\'t answer our calls. We finally tracked down someone at his office who would answer the phone, XXXX, he said there was some fee that was supposed to be paid, but this was the first we had heard of it. He said there was nothing more to do. We started packing up and they came to throw us out of the house on XXXX XXXX.  \"\n",

In XX/XX/XXXX we moved from XXXX to XXXX.  The card has an annual fee which was always paid on time when billed. Because of the move we did not receive the bill and the issuer added late charges and fees to the annual fee. They never called either me or my husband to let us know we had a balance and to collect, we are both over XXXX and this should have been a factor.  When I finally received the bill 3 months later forwarded from my old address I called Zions. I paid the entire amount including fees and late charges ( {$25.00} annual fee with late charges totaled {$75.00} ) and they said they would pull the negative credit reporting. I also closed the account due to their obvious lack of valuing us as a customer and lack of customer service.  The issue today is that the negative 30 day late is still on our credit reports. They reported it as closed by credit grantor which is inaccurate because we requested it be closed, It is the only negative item but it affects our overall credit score.  I \\'ve called Zions bank XXXX times and they request that I send a letter explaining what happened each time. I do n\\'t know what they do with the letters because they should have them in triplicate at this point.  Due to our ages and previous payment history the fact they never called to find out why we had n\\'t paid an annual fee but instead adding late charges to it, borders on elder abuse, and I feel it should be reported.  \"\n",

The bank told me there is nothing they can do, XXXX pick the check up at noon, and they do not have the check in front of them.The bank policy is to take your money, but have restrictions on how they disburse your money.I do n\\'t have to be present to deposit the money, but present when they cash the tax check, and there are no documentation, or check scan on computer proof of check deposit.I feel I have been lied to and inconvenience.  \"\n",

Shortly after hanging up from speaking with the supervisor I received an alert from one of my credit monitoring services advising that an account had been added. When I checked it was the XXXX account which I had not called to discuss this account as it had been removed. Equifax is in violation of the FCRA as they added this account back to my credit report without advising that this was going to happen. I also have a complaint about the XXXX Dept of Education accounts that they keep reporting an additional {$5.00} to the account balance. I have spoken with the Dept of Education and they advised that they would not update the account as it is in the rehab program. Equifax is updating and changing files without the proper information from the credit provider. I plan to contact an attorney to assist with this violation if it is not corrected asap. Equifax needs to be investigated for their behavior and retaliation against those that call them out on it.  \"\n",

I respectfully request to be provided proof of this alleged item, specifically the contract, note or other instrument bearing my signature. Failing that, the item must be deleted from the report as soon as possible.   I have been asking for an instrument bearing my signature from Equifax regarding the removal of this tradeline for over 6 months.   The listed item is entirely inaccurate and as such represents a very serious error in your reporting.   Please be advised that I am not requesting a verification that you have my mailing address ; rather, I am requesting validation, i.e., competent evidence that I had some contractual obligation sans consumer protection encumbrance which incurred the original claims associated with this tradeline. Note that section 1681s-2 ( b ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act creates a cause of action for a consumer against a furnisher of erroneous credit information ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ).   Please know that you have 30 days to either answer these demands or to remove the associated negative tradeline notations from the CRA reports. Any other action may constitute evidence of your intent to abridge XXXX or more civil or other constitutional rights. Please be further advised that continued unsubstantiated reporting of possible inaccuracies to third parties may provide a basis for criminal complaints being filed in accordance with FDCPA, FCRA, and other federal statutes.   I am distressed that you have included the information below in my credit profile and that you have failed to maintain reasonable procedures in your operations to assure maximum possible accuracy in the credit reports you publish.   Credit reporting laws ensure that bureaus report only 100 % accurate credit information. Every step must be taken to assure the information reported is completely accurate and correct.   Please delete this misleading information and supply a corrected credit profile to all creditors who have received a copy within the last six months.   Additionally, please provide the name, address, and telephone number of each credit grantor or other subscriber.   Under federal law, you have thirty ( 30 ) days to complete your re-investigation. Be advised that the description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information is hereby requested as well, to be provided within fifteen ( 15 ) days of the completion of your re-investigation.  \"\n",

Recently, my husband was off work due to a XXXX and we were late in making our payment. We advised Greentree that the payment would not be made until the XXXX of the month, when we would have another paycheck. They continued to call 3-4 times a day and also at my place of employment. I questioned this and told them that I had previously requsted that no calls be made to me at my place of employment. They indicated that the account was noted and they had called in error. In the past 3 weeks I have received over XXXX calls from Greentree at my place of employment by the same individual that indicated that my account was noted for no more calls. I had even gone so far as requesting that the phone number be removed from their system, yet they continue to call. My 2nd issue is that their billing statements do not list what the monthly payment is. We recently had an escrow change, and I paid that amount and the payment say in unapplied and was not credited to a payment. The analysis indicated my payment was {$1200.00} yet when I paid {$1200.00}, the payment again sat in unapplied and did not post to my account. Yet they continue to call me day and night AND at my place of employment. No where on the billing statement does it give a breakdown of what is due ;. Since the last notification I recvd for a payment change was the Analysis in XXXX, I have paid that amount yet, the payment still sits in unapplied. They refuse to indicate what the past due payment represents. Since the loan transferred to GT about 2 years ago, we were only late this one time XXXX XX/XX/XXXX 2016 ) and now the XXXX payment is sitting in undisbursed. They have an obligation to explain the amount due, which they do not. I want action taken against them for continuing to harass me at work multiple times a day when it is very clear that they have my request to not receive calls at work. Since my loan transferred, I have also been charged a late charge, when per my contract, I should have been. It indicates a late charge would be assessed on the unpaid principal and interest portion of my payment. I made the principal and interest prior to the end of my XXXX day grace period, yet they still charged me a late charge, because my escrow portion of the payment had not been paid ( I paid that the following week ). They are impossible to work with and do not answer questions when asked and frustrate me to the point where I ca n\\'t take their calls. I have no intention of defaulting on my loan but they continue to treat me rudely and threaten me.  \"\n",

Every month beginning on the XXXX we get repeated automated phone messages from CitiMortgage and after a few minutes a representative comes on the line and begins to go through the whole disclosure speech about the call being recorded and being an attempt to collect a debt etc. XXXX we are able to intercede we tell the representative that our mortgage payment is just due and we have by agreement a fifteen day grace period to make the payment. We further state that if they check their records they will see that all of our payments have been credited before the grace period has elapsed. We ask politely to not call back unless we fail to have our payment to them by the fifteenth of the month. Usually they are rude and say that the reason for the call is that it is the first of the month and the payment is due. We get nowhere with them and ask thatthey refrain from calling again. However, this cycle is repeated over and over again sometimes 3 or 4 times a day. Each time a different representative who claims there is no record of any previous call in their system. Yea right! This practice of harassment has been going on each month for the last year. My wife has to field these calls all day long and is frustrated that we can not find a method to have them cease. I have threatened lidigation, contacted the do not call list and have had to become forceful in my response to them on the phone all in hopes we can stop this harassment. Nothing has worked. Every time I speak to a manager ( I assume they are what they say they are XXXX they apologize but the calls keep coming in. What can I do to stop this nuisance.  \"\n",

The representative asked the mal if they were authorize to make payments on my loan. The male said, \\\" yes \\'\\'. I am the only person on my loan, sole owner of this property without any third party contacts or co-borrowers. As a result, my bank account was overdrawn by {$1000.00}. I was informed by XXXX from Wells Fargo Mortgage that a previous representative made an outbound call to the home and used my previous banking information that was on file to submit the transaction. The male that they are referring to is my son, whom does not know my banking information or any of my personal information. The representative failed to use proper protocol procedures and failed to abide by XXXX Law. I was told that this is a negative on my behalf and can be sought out to be writing bad checks. I requested a reversal of this transaction, I was told it will take 3-4 business days but there will be several ( 4 ) insufficient fund fees totaling {$140.00} that would be charged to my account not along the outstanding fees from the other companies. I am requesting that my money be refunded back to my account, all overdraft fees be waived, and that they pay for the company insufficient fund fees along with a letter of resolution and my credit report clear from this matter.  \"\n",

GreenSky processed a fraudulent/unauthorized transaction from a merchant and did not even follow their own procedure for an authorized transaction and is now trying to make us responsible for the full transaction ( {$18000.00} ). Over the course of 60 days we have made numerous request in writing and by phone to have this unauthorized charge remove. Their position seems to be that a self-serving document from the merchant is what they are acting on even though we never authorized any transaction by any means at any time and they can not produce any evidence that we ever wanted this transaction. My wife and I have tried patiently over many months to work with them but they are refusing to charge back to the merchant and properly zero out our account and close it permanently as requested numinous times. We have extensive documentation to support our position and to refute any rational they may offer.   Please help us.   Sincerely Yours,  \"\n",

I went into my bank ( US BANK XXXX and filed a complaint for fraud. they issued me a provisional credit on XXXX XXXX as XXXX XXXX was not responding to me or them. after 90 days I received a letter from US Bank resolutions dept that their investigation was completed and my credit was now permanent. Upon recieivng this information I thought all was done. Sadlly on XXXX they reveresed their decision and took the monies back stating XXXX XXXX had produced a signed receipt ( which I have never done ) I told the agent she swiped my card on a square card thru her phone and I never signed anything now was i given a receipt ( I know XXXX XXXX as a long time acquaintance and have bought from her in the past ) this reversal of monies overdrew my account and US bank charged me {$140.00} in fees. I was devasted that my bank could do this after giving me a letter telling me the fraudulent credit was permanent. I called US Bank and was told the reolution agent would call me on XXXX and they would aslo send me the receipt all of which I have not received nor has anyone ever called me.

XXXX did pay me with a cashiers check of {$800.00} issued thru her XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account thus the new balance owing me is {$890.00}. I asked XXXX to dispute this new balance and get me a provisional credit. to date Nothing has been done. I was back in her office on Monday XXXX XXXX and she informend me she was still working on it. Yet no one has reacehd out or returned my calls or emails, I went online and emailed customer service thru my account and emailed XXXX XXXX XXXX as well again on XXXX. I am not getting Anywhere and feel cheated and stolen from. I will also be filing a complaint on XXXX XXXX XXXX by XXXX who operates out of her home. I now have to labor this with small claims court as well. How can my bank issue me a credit tell me its permanent and then take it back?

I received email form Nationstar that I was late and I called Nationstar to let them know my payment has already been sent to them my usual way by my bank and I see the debit in my account. I got XXXX XXXX on the phone XXXX way to confirm the payment. The customer service lady told me I should wait since it takes a couple of days for the payment to post. Yesterday XXXX XXXX, I noticed the credit in my account called XXXX XXXX and was told Nation Star has rejected the payment again XXXX times that was the reason for the credit and we went through verifying that my Nationstar account to be credited was correct. I called Nationstar and this time when I explained what XXXX XXXX said that Nationstar had rejected the payment twice, Nationstar proceeded to say the reason for the reject was because it has to be certified funds. I asked how certified does the funds has to be, cashiers check XXXX XXXX etc because I could not even make a payment on Nationstar website my account was blocked. I asked why was this not communicated to me earlier so I could have taken care of this sooner than now. I was told they send me mail. I said to them ever since my account was transferred to Nationstar all communications from us has been electronic why did they not send me such an important document the same way but chose to send it by paper mail. Bottom line is I have gone to XXXX XXXX today to make the payment I just do n\\'t think I should be reported to the Bureaus as late when I made the effort to make a payment. If they had told me the XXXX time when I called that my payment was not going to be accepted that way because of the block on the account I could have taken care of the payment before it became late. I can not even refinance with Nationstar because of the late payment.  If its XXXX intention for us to lose our home its not going to happen.  \"\n",

Meanwhile my credit was destroyed and the home has XXXX HOA liens and Wells Fargo still has not taken title and now claims they have reneged on the DIL. Now they are harassing me for the mortgage payments. I moved back in the home and have been asking to work with them on a modified loan but they refuse to help me. They call me XXXX to XXXX times a day yet no one will speak to me about a loan modification. I am certain they are just looking to rack up fines and fees so they can be reimbursed by Fannie Mae or whatever unethical business practice they are up to. They have destroyed my life and continue to do so. I just want to stay in my home and pay my mortgage but I need the to work with me. I would n\\'t even be in t his mess if t hey had just recorded the DIL when they were supposed to. They are so unethical I can not believe they can get away with such fraud.  \"\n",

I asked why this was the case and I was told they needed to research the situation and would get back with me but my seat was reserved and the price would not increase. I was never contacted after many attempts but I was emailed documentation showing I could bid to update this rain-check reservation trip into a business seat. I guessed the issue had been resolved but I had not contacted.

I had enough and I knew I had 6 months to open a dispute with American Express as I was getting nowhere with XXXX. I explained the situation in full to american express with documentation and I also explained that XXXX had been very unprofessional and unresponsive thus far and I would be surprised if American express would get anywhere as well with them in this matter. XXXX did not respond to AMEX and the credit card company proceeded to decline my dispute on these grounds alone. I immediately re disputed the charges with AMEX since the 6 month dispute window was close to having passed only to have them state that they may not succeed considering 6 months have now passed. My account has now been charged {$2100.00} for a ticket that was never honored to no fault of my own.

If I were able to consolidate it with my federal loans, I would easily be able to make the payment every month. Instead, I am deferring my federal loans because they allow it, and paying my other private loans as I am able, but forced to pick and choose on a monthly basis which I am able to pay. I have looked into every possible consolidation option, but they all require a decent credit score. I have terrible credit as a result of student loans, exclusively.  I have explored every possible option with Chase to lower or reduce or delay my payment. They are unwilling to work with me in any capacity, and have repeatedly shunned any effort that I have made to attempt a solution that is tenable. I budget very well, and I have attempted to raise my income in numerous ways. However, my negative credit is affecting my employment advancement, as many employers consider credit history, which in turn is affecting my ability to raise my income enough to meet all my payments. If I were able to consolidate with my federal loans, I would happily go on income-based repayment and repay the loan faithfully until it is paid in full, but this is somehow still not an option, and I did n\\'t understand the difference when I was XXXX years old, and the interest rate was lower at the time than the federal loans, and thought I was making a practical financial decision. I am not attempting to shirk my responsibility, but there are some months when I decide between paying all of my loans/rent/vehicle, versus buying groceries. How is this right? What did I do wrong? What can I do now?  \"\n",

A XXXX XXXX asked me to send copies of XXXX check and bank statement which I did.  Recently, a XXXX.

For about two years now, XXXX person will say XXXX thing and another person says something different.  This has caused my credit to be poor.  I need some help and thanks in advance.

I applied for a part time job as a mystery shopper as I have just gotten social security and it is n\\'t enough to cover my bills. I received an over night package XX/XX/XXXX while I was out of town visiting my son who had just found out that he had a XXXX. My neighbor opened the package for me and saw it was a check for {$2900.00} and it was my first assignment as a mystery shopper. I was to go to the bank and cash the check or deposit the check and take {$400.00} for myself and go into a XXXX and wire money to another mystery shopper to determine their level of service. When I got back in town on XXXX XXXX, I did as the letter and went to my local Wells Fargo and asked the teller, XXXX XXXX, a personal banker if the check was good and he said not today but I can deposit it for you and it could be in the next few days. So I told him that I agreed with that, not knowing what else to do. Then the next day I look at my deposits which consisted of XXXX checks and {$600.00} in cash and none of it was in my bank. I went down to see XXXX to ask what happened and after much computer and phone investigation he found out that all my accounts were locked and were being closed. When I asked why, he said that the check that I deposited was a counterfeit check. I asked what that was and he explained that the account that the check was written from did n\\'t exist. I said I had never heard of such a thing, either a check is good or bad. He was the one who told me to deposit the check and now all my money is frozen and my social security check gets deposited into those accounts and it is only {$1100.00} per money but it is all I have coming in. They are in the process of closing my accounts and will mail me a check they say in the next two weeks for with the money in my accounts but I have nothing to live on and I will not be able to get social security check next week. I think it is terrible that Wells Fargo is blaming me, the XXXX who got duped even though I brought them all the proof of this scam and XXXX is even backing up my details of the incident but Wells Fargo \\'s fraud department does n\\'t care.

XXXX XXXX agreed to relieve me of all financial obligation, garnishments, and prompt deletion of credit entries in exchange for a one-time payment of {$3000.00}. The payment was immediately rendered and the stipulations were signed by a judge of the XXXX County District Court that same month. Experian keeps verifying the debt as valid because XXXX XXXX is supplying fictitious information because collection efforts remain in effect for XXXX party on account. XXXX County District Court has assured me that they do not verify debts, make entries to credit reports or make deletions.  XXXX also has an account listed by XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$81.00}. This account was paid directly to XXXX several months ago. I was never contacted by XXXX by any means. The representative that I spoke with said the account would be deleted but she could not send in writing. She referred me to a website to print a paid letter. I have proof that I paid XXXX directly.  XXXX is also listing the erroneous account by XXXX XXXX as past due in the amount of {$1500.00}. XXXX also has several collection accounts that have been paid and I have provided written proof supplied by the collection agency for medical bills. The companies are XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX collections. The collection companies agreed to delete the entries electronically but they remain on my credit file.  Additionally, XXXX XXXX XXXX has an open claim with XXXX XXXX for damages on a vehicle that I rented in South Dakota from XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX while on of several travel contracts for work at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was never notified and allowed to investigate the validity of the debt. When I realized it on my credit report, I called XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX who agreed to delete the entry if I paid her because she did not believe the XXXX would pay the \\\" extra fees \\'\\'. The was minor under baggage damage that was not visible to me when the vehicle was returned. I was made aware of the collection efforts when I checked my credit earlier this year. This account appears on my Experian credit report and was verified as valid. I never received notice of the debt. I was never allowed to investigate the validity of the alleged debt.  Lastly, XXXX XXXX XXXX was paid {$720.00} in XX/XX/XXXX in an effort to have them remove a collection from my XXXX and Experian credit reports. Despite me never contracting with company I paid them because XXXX refused to collect the monies owed to them. I now have a delinquent XXXX entry and a XXXX XXXX collection account for the same debt. I have made several calls to request deletion of improper entry to my credit report but was told it is not their policy to delete especially since I had already paid. I never received notices. The item just appeared on my credit report. I was never allowed to validate the debt.  \"\n",

Wells Fargo has a business relationship with XXXX XXXX and I think it \\\" encourages \\'\\' them to go soft on XXXX Insulation because of it.  I asked XXXX for an opinion about this in the following email, but got a very deflective answer.   XXXX XXXX XXXX Reply to AskXXXX A vendor, XXXX XXXX offered, and we accepted, a financing arrangement offered by Wells Fargo. We \\'ve lodged a complaint that has been with Wells Fargo for resolution for a while.   My question : since this merchant/service provider, who is both vendor and installer and on-site producer of the product, has a mutually beneficial business arrangement with the card issuer, can I trust the issuer to be completely objective?   Thank you?  XXXX XXXX XXXX Sent from Mail XXXX \\'\\' This is they reply I received : XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ( 13 days ago ) Reply to me Thank you for contacting XXXX.   We value your business and regret that we can not directly help you with this situation. XXXX does not set up, service, or have access to cardholder or merchant accounts. This is done through our client financial institutions ( the banks ). Each financial institution has its own criteria for issuing XXXX cards, interest rates and credit lines.   Please contact the financial institution that issued your XXXX product using the address or telephone number on your account statement. This number XXXX also appear on your card. The financial institution can directly address your inquiry.   As an alternative, XXXX cardholders can also contact the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX ( XXXX ) or XXXX ( Direct ) for further assistance.   Thank you for writing, XXXX XXXX \\'\\' I had provided Wells Fargo with an extensive description, verifiable evidence, and photos of the evidence of a foam insulation job by XXXX XXXX. The nature of the complaint was XXXX fold. 1.There were a large number of significant voids where the foam insulation was assumed to reach. XXXX came back to top off the upper wall areas. When an electrician was adding some receptacles to the home, we found large voids at the lower portions of the walls. 2. Later we found the foam insulation shrank 10 % in all dimensions/directions. In that shrinking process it broke up randomly inside the walls leaving variable gaps and voids. We contacted XXXX XXXX. They offered a {$2000.00} settlement, but stood silent when I asked what the repair for the shrunken insulation was.  I had XXXX contractors listed on the internet under insulation repair come out. None wanted to estimate the repair cost, but described it as removing plaster, lath, then re-insulating and drywalling the home.  Wells Fargo \\'s XXXX XXXX called. I asked if the settlement could exceed the price of the job. She said it could not. I explained that I had offered to discount the claim to {$3500.00} if XXXX if they acted BEFORE I had to write up the complaint and wait out Wells Fargo \\'s action.  Since they had not responded by the time Wells Fargo wrote me to present my case, that offer was void. According to Wells Fargo, XXXX said they had offered me a {$3500.00} settlement. This is a pattern of theirs, if XXXX reads XXXX complaints against XXXX. My last proposed settlement was {$4500.00} based on {$6500.00} job, {$500.00} off the top to Wells Fargo ( their business arrangement w/vendor ) and {$1500.00} to XXXX for the {$900.00} attic insulation job they did ( they claim it \\'s worth {$2500.00} XXXX, and nothing for the foam injection wall insulation job that leaves me with a property defect.  Wells Fargo came back with a disappointing repeat of XXXX XXXX \\'s statement that they offered me a settlement. No justification of the amount ; no calculation of the value received, not even a \\\" sorry about your luck. \\'\\'  \"\n",

I have gone around and around with Ally several times why I feel the charges are not accurate and request that a manager call me - which to this date has never happened. I want them to give me an explanation on what these charges are for and why they are refusing to dismiss - since the car was parked in the lot 3 weeks in a super tight lot - who knows who dinged the car in that time period.   The car was sold at auction - and knowing that they are trying to make more money from me when they made their money ( and more ) from the auction dealer - is even more ludicrous and appalling.   I am filing this complaint especially after seeing the XXXX dollar law suit that has been charged against them - and the unfair practices that they are known for.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"Chase Home Finance has been since XX/XX/XXXX, showing me behind on my mortgage payments. I bought my house XX/XX/XXXX, and made my first payment to XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a statement from Chase home Finance stating that I am behind approximately {$3300.00} on a XXXX XXXX, XXXX statement. I start disputing this information not only with Chase but with XXXX XXXX XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I receive an apology letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that I have not been behind on my payments, all payments have been made on time to date. I thought the issue was resolved. it was not. XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a statement from Chase Home Finance stating I am approximately {$3300.00} behind dated XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a second statement from Chase stating I am approximately {$5400.00} behind, dated XX/XX/XXXX. One day later, 24 hours apart, both letters are in accurate. there is no way on earth, within a 24 hour period, could I be behind a difference of over {$2500.00}? I have paid all payments via XXXX XXXX and I have all original records. XX/XX/XXXX, I pay my payment, and later that month receive a letter from XXXX XXXX stating Chase Refused my payment. I sent in two payment in XX/XX/XXXX and again I receive a letter from XXXX XXXX stating Chase refuse my payment. I finally contact customer service XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX and THEY TELL ME they are taking me through a modification. I state \\\" NO you are not, I have been paying my payments, I am not behind, leave me alone. I fight with them for two months, at which time I gave in and said fine. It takes Chase another 6 months or more to approve me, the modification took my payment from {$1100.00} to {$1000.00} and now I am behind because of Chase failure to accept my payments in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX.  I have went to the Nevada Foreclosure Mediation with Chase XX/XX/XXXX to no avail. prior to the mediation, I pulled all my original records and performed a complete financial audit of my entire account since day one, along with all statements associated with those payments. My accounting came within {$380.00} of Chase numbers, meaning, Chase has been debiting my account instead of crediting my account. For Example, XX/XX/XXXX, I paid a {$1000.00} payment to Chase, the very next month, my XX/XX/XXXX statement shows a credit of {$0.00}. XXXX Penny, they credited me XXXX penny, not the {$1000.00} payment, but XXXX penny??? Chase \\'s was suppose to do a complete financial audit of my account. I receive a telephone XX/XX/XXXX, from XXXX from the Executive Offices for Chase, and she said \\\" XXXX XXXX, you are correct about the amount we said you owed, you only owe approximately {$8600.00} from XXXX XXXX to date, not the {$12000.00} we said you owed. \\'\\' That is one example, in a line of examples that I can prove with documentation that Chase has been fraudulently trying to foreclose on my home. I attach all documentation with the financial audit I did, the spreadsheet and all attached back up of all payments for your review. I need help with Chase because they just denied me a modification due to my other modification that I should not have went through to begin with. XX/XX/XXXX, I had a credit of over {$2000.00} when they refused my payments, stating I was behind and they were going to take me through a loan modification. I did not want that one, and it took them over 6 months or more, to approve it. meanwhile, I am getting further behind on my mortgage payments, due to no fault of my own. I attach all documentation for your review and have much more if you need it. thank you.  Now, since XX/XX/XXXX, Chase is claiming I am behind in my mortgage payments of over {$48000.00}, and during my XX/XX/XXXX modification, place a XXXX lien on my home for over {$42000.00}.  \"\n",

I am unable to speak with anyone, as well, when I use their site to file a complaint, the info does not go through. Excuses keep occurring. Last year my score was over XXXX, this year a week ago my score is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, my ceiling was raised to {$500.00} unsecured from {$200.00} secured credit card ending in XXXX. I had to change the card I believe on XXXX occasions due to a XXXX stealing my debit card and committing a felony against me by using my card at an ATM in XXXX, as well, they could not arrest her for less than a felony amount due to the XXXX gas station not having cameras, where she filled her gas tank in XXXX XXXX. I changed out both of my cards at that time, XXXX to be safe. I had to file bankruptcy in XXXX, due to ID theft in XXXX in XXXX. via computer. Someone changed my password and my secret question and e-mailed my entire contact list of people on a XXXX acct., some of which were my clients, when I owned a business, XXXX XXXX. The name of the company is \\\" XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX. I had to go to the Atty. Generals office to file with them so I would not get sued by any of my contacts, or embarrassed. The e-mails said I was stuck in XXXX and needed {$2000.00} to get home. Upon all the 6 months of work myself with the XXXX reporting credit companies, not XXXX of them offered to look at a camera of XXXX of the places that false credit cards were being developed and used, and there were different addresses that the credit cards were going to with my name being abused to be identity thefted as well as false SS # \\'s, as well as false phone numbers. I still did not get back my contact list from XXXX, even with the Atty. General \\'s office help. Recently upon checking the XXXX credit companies, included were incorrect phone numbers that I never owned as well as addresses, and I was ID thefted in XXXX when someone used my SS # to do their taxes with. The man that did my taxes was from XXXX, XXXX XXXX, phone number ( XXXX ) XXXX. I am XXXX and on a fixed income, there is no way that my score went from over XXXX to XXXX which is what Experian is claiming. I called the XXXX XXXX XXXX and asked them to go over my activity since I had a debit card in XXXX, as well as 2 years ago, a secured credit card then it became unsecured a year ago. I am trying to build my credit into the XXXX, I want to know how Experian came up with the low score of XXXX. This is a steep decline with no reason at all.  1. Experian is claiming I have \\'too few accounts currently being paid as agreed. \\' I have never had accounts open since before XXXX with XXXX banks that I paid off the over drawn accounts due to an employee stealing my cards to use for himself rather than for the company supplies. The names of the banks are as follows ; 1. XXXX XXXX Paid in full XXXX, 2. XXXX XXXX paid in full XXXX, 3. XXXX XXXX Paid in full XXXX. All were in XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Currently every month I have a \\\" XXXX \\\" balance with proof from XXXX XXXX XXXX on my credit card.  2. Experian is claiming I have \\'lack of recent loan installment \\' which I have never had a loan installment since before XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which is paid in full. 3. Experian is claiming \\'no recent revolving balances \\' as I stated as well as the XXXX XXXX XXXX states, I have perfect activity since I have opened an account in XXXX.  4. Experian is claiming \\'serious delinquency, and public record or collection filed, \\' I filed bankruptcy due to ID theft in XXXX in XXXX . XXXX XXXX helped with this matter.

I strongly believe that I am not responsible to continue paying on these loans because I did not finish the course. The schools curriculum was not that of a regular college. XXXX was over packed with teacher to student ratio. In the class room the students had to stand or find setting because they over packed there classes. Half the time the book store did not have the books needed for the class and they where on back order ; this cause student to have to wait to take a class and or share with a class mate. This made students unable to finish work on time.   I want to be able to go back to school and finish my degree, but I am not able to due to so with this genesis loan.

I would like Experian to know that I did in-fact send them a letter disputing information on my credit report. I also give Experian my full consent to continue with the investigation of my accounts per the dispute letter I wrote to them.  I researched a dispute letter online and just used that to manifest my dispute. Although I carefully reviewed Experian \\'s website to figure out exactly what I needed to do to file a dispute, I suppose it is possible that I may have missed something. I would truly appreciate Experian providing me with an explanation of my rights specifically pertaining to how I am allowed to dispute information on my credit report.  I need to know what made my letter \\\" suspicious \\'\\' and why Experian would think that someone else would want to have my credit report investigated. Does n\\'t investigating my credit only really benefit me?  I would like Experian to let me know if I can re-write my letter and if Experian could provide me with an example of a letter that would be acceptable to them since the one I wrote is not good enough.  I work very hard all day and can not afford to take time off to dispute my accounts. I also do not have the money to be represented by an attorney or any other agency. Would completing a dispute over the phone provide me with the same benefits as the letter? And if the results would be the same, why not just accept my letter?  \"\n",

They have never properly investigated my disputes and have continued to report false information causing my credit scores to go down tremendously.

If they continue to break the FDCPA laws and the FCRA, I will have no choice but to hire a lawyer and sue. I will file a complaint with the FTC as well as I believe that Resurgent ( aka LVNV ) needs to be thoroughly investigated for their illegal practices.

I checked with the company to be sure that I could submit advance checks for the mortgage amount to be credited each month and NOT TO BE CHARGED AS A LUMP SUM PAYMENT REDUCING THE PRINCIPAL. I was told I could do this and was given instructions on how to ensure the transactions occurred as I wanted. On XXXX XXXX, I mailed XXXX individual checks for each month : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX with a memo on each check for the appropriate individual month \\'s payment.

XXXX and was told that due to the new payment system NAF \\\" is at least 10 days behind posting and my payment should be posted Thursday and there would be no late charge even though the posting date would be real time. On XXXX XXXX I checked my bank statement and there is a transaction for each month \\'s check reducing my bank balance. On XXXX XXXX I called and was told that the corrections would be made within 7 days per the instructions I had originally submitted -- that there was an indication of a \\\" notation in the system \\'\\' but it is not clear what it is - that the problems with their payment system are now corrected. I asked when would the corrections be made and she said she would call me to confirm the transactions have been corrected. I am skeptical because my instructions were clearly understood from the beginning ( or I was made to understand so ) and it appears they were ignored. I want to be sure the corrections are made, my instructions are followed as indicated in my letter to them and my follow up telephone conversations, that my bank account is reimbursed for the funds taken for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. I do n\\'t know what benefit resolution could accrue to be because they have debited by account 15 days prior to the XXXX mortgage due date, but if there is any I would like to know. If there is little or nothing in that regard, I will settle for the amount of the check for the XXXX 2015 mortgage due to be properly processed as requested and that New American Funding ensure that this problem is fixed and no customer has to endure this kind of stress of ineptness in the future ; especially when so much is done up front to avoid problems and confusion.

I did, and i received a confirmation number. I was told 24 to 48 hours to remolve hold. Five days later I am told it was not received and they need XXXX forms of ID.

As a result I have a fraud alert requiring companies to contact me prior to approval for credit. Over the last 2 years Capital One has called/sent letters asking if I applied for credit which I have not. I have responded by phone and in writing that I have not applied/authorized said inquires on my credit and they needed to be removed. Your company stated in response to a previous CFPB Complaint and said that you would remove the unauthorized inquires once I faxed a copy of my credit report. Which was done the day that it was requested. Well now over a month later not only do they still remain but the number of inquires have since increased. Between all XXXX credit bureaus there are over XXXX total. Under FCRA ( codified at Title 15 United States Code Section 1681 and following ) this constitutes Willful Noncompliance in reporting on your behalf.  Although your company seems to think that you can take advantage of what you perceive to be an uninformed consumer, I am far from that. I know that under FCRA each separate incident ( Inquiry ) reported where your company has failed to prove Permissible Purpose I am eligible for {$2500.00}. Now as we both know I can retain a law firm that I have worked with very closely in the past do handle this matter and they would gladly take the case and file suit. Your company in an effort to avoid a lengthy lawsuit costing thousands of dollars in attorneys fees and court cost would attempt to settle. Now that is a route I do n\\'t mind going but serving in the XXXX XXXX XXXX of the values instilled in us daily was integrity. Due to the fact I do n\\'t think it \\'s fair for your company to immediately be forced into paying my attorneys fees and so on I am going to afford you XXXX final opportunity to resolve this matter on a voluntary basis. I do want you to bear in mind I also do n\\'t believe it is fair that your company being the \\'Big Business \\' you are completely ignores this offer to resolve and merely offers to correct the problem. The XXXX are not XXXX in the same and if you treat them as such I will cease all contact and file suit against your company.  Here is what I am proposing you immediately remove any and all inquiries from all XXXX credit bureaus and pay me a settlement of {$10000.00}. The offer for settlement is more than fair considering your cost in legal fees would far exceed that amount. This must be done on or before 14 calendar days from receipt of this notice. If you opt to not to do so then I will have no choice but to seek the full amount entitled to under FCRA plus actual damages. Please confirm receipt of this notice by calling XXXX.  Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter, XXXX XXXX  \"\n",

I went in with the intention of making my obligatory {$500.00} deposit with the check. I did not think or even realize that I had to inform the teller how to process the transcations.

There was no way to access an actual operator to provide them with the Reference Number ( which presumably should have made finding my report quite easy ). Instead, it simply repeated the mailing address and necessary supporting documents. When going through the experian.com/reportaccess site, I also received the same denial of accessing it through their online system, and was told to submit my request in writing to the same address.  It \\'s ironic to note that Experian does not accept mailed credit card statements as proof of address ; given how many people are using electronic statements only in this day and age, it \\'s not always easy to find XXXX of their accepted forms of mail.   I will note that I have ALWAYS received this type of complication from Experian, also while trying to claim my free annual credit report as required by law.   I assert that Experian purposely makes their \\\" Free \\'\\' system hard to retrieve reports from, in an attempt to get people to purchase their reports instead.

Merchant : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXOn XXXX -- I held my son \\'s XXXX party with the merchant listed about. The complaint is as followed : A written statement was sent to inform merchant of my negative/positive experience with the food and services that I paid for on XXXX. First the food was great, however, I am very disappointed in the level of service that was provided. Per the contract, the staff was to look after my party and refill buffet food accordingly especially when XXXX XXXX imposes a mandatory 20 % gratuity/Service charge, I expected the service to be great and up to par. Unfortunately, the initial service by the staff was unsatisfactory and was not meet per the contract. Listed below is a quick summary as to why : -- - The waitresses at the beginning were not attentive to my guess -- drink service and refills! Staff did not notify my wife or me when the food was ready so we were not able to inform our guests that they could serve themselves My guests made their own decision as to attending the buffet which is unacceptable.   -- - Merchant informed us per the contract that someone was going to be alert and keep an eye on the food so when food was running low more food would be put out. We ran out of the XXXX more than XXXX and it took almost XXXX minutes for them to be replenish. -- -unacceptable. brench of contract -- - Also at the beginning when we first arrived the waitress introduce herself and stated that she was going to be with our party, but when we were ready to order some pitchers of beer and our guest trying to obtain refills they were nowhere to be found. This was frustrating to my guests and embarrassing to me. At the end the waitresses were there and they were doing their job and even help cut the cake, but by this time the negative experience outweighed the positive XXXX.   Overall our experience was OK, if XXXX is going to implement a mandated 20 % gratuity/service charge we expect 100 % service not 80 % not 70 %. At a minimum I would expect some type of adjustment to the fee/tip. Again, the food was great, but the initial service was unsatisfactory which made my husband very unhappy and was embarrassed by the actions occurred.   Respectfully,  \"\n",

The terms of the contract were {$100.00} to cover the cost of the uniform, etc, and 12 monthly payments of {$99.00} each ( total monthly payments to be {$1100.00} ). My debit card was charged {$100.00} by XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for the down payment.   On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, my debit card was charged by XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$99.00} for the first two monthly payments.   On XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX my debit card was also charged $ XXXX monthly payments, except instead of being charged directly by Martial Arts Legacy it was being charged through their payment company.   When I noticed the XXXX charge, I called the billing company and told them to stop billing my debit card. They agreed, and I guess in turn notified XXXX XXXX XXXX, who then informed me that I still owed them 2 payments. I told them I had already made all of my payments, and they responded by stating they would send my account to collection for the final 2 payments ( which I had already paid ).   Not including the down payment ( which I knew was separate ), I made 13 monthly payments of {$99.00} to Martial Arts Legacy when I should have only made XXXX. This summer I received a letter from Collection Services of Nevada ( CSN ) stating that they were attempting to collect a debt of {$190.00} for XXXX. I went to their office and provided them with a copy of my contract, along with copies of bank statements showing that all of my monthly payments ( plus one additional ) had been made.   On XX/XX/XXXX I received another letter from CSN stating that they \\\" do not agree with your position \\'\\' and claiming that they had \\\" supporting documents \\'\\' that showed the debt was valid and that they \\'d sent me \\\" validation of the debt. \\'\\' Just for good measure, they threatened to file a law suit if I did n\\'t pay.   They have never sent me copies of their \\\" supporting documents \\'\\' nor \\\" validation of the debt, \\'\\' I have provided them with proof ( bank statements ) showing that all payments to XXXX XXXX XXXX were made, yet they are still reporting this to credit agencies and threatening me with a law suit.

Since 2004 they have been garnishing my pay for this. After 11 years you would think this has been paid off a while ago. We have noticed for years they will start and stop garnishment. Never sending us any kind of accountability how much was taken out or balance owing. Every XXXX they start garnishing my wages for a month or so, then it stops. We never hear from them again until they start a new writ the end of XXXX. We get paperwork in the mail. Also enclosed is a Wage Garnishment Exemption Claim, stating we have 28 days/4 weeks to respond. They never give us a chance to respond, because they have already submitted collections to my payroll. We see what they are doing. They are taking so much out, leaving a balance to keep adding interest on for a year then send to payroll for collections. Why ca n\\'t after each time they take money from me, I get a balance from them so I can go ahead and pay in full? When I got this on Thursday, I called and asked this question and nobody wants to respond to this. They are nickel and finding me. I called Citibank years ago and was told this account had been written off many years ago and they have no record of payments. I called and told XXXX this and they told me it does not matter and when I had asked for contact to Citibank they would not give to me. I had to find contact myself. I feel after 11 years of supposedly paying off a {$7700.00} debt this should have been paid off a long time ago. We feel they are taking advantage and just trying to get as much money from us as they can.  \"\n",

All communication to me by the bank was sent electronically and was never received. I incurred and paid {$120.00} in late fees for the {$14.00} charge. The Bank never notified me that my account was past due and that it was being reported to the credit agencies. On XXXX/XXXX/15 I was mailed a hard copy letter informing me that my account was cancelled and that the delinquency was reported to the credit agencies. No communication of this issue was made known to me by mail before XXXX/XXXX/15. Customer service at the credit card company/BANK is unresponsive. Promises to remediate have been made with no follow up. The credit card company has admitted to me that proper notification procedures were not followed. No follow up or further communication by the card company has been completed. Principal and late fees totaling {$130.00} have been paid even though the original charge in question was only {$14.00}. The primary problem is email communication including bill delivery that likely never reached my inbox due to spam filtering. Lesson learned, do not select electronic bill payment and presentment.

I was able to continue making payments towards my mortgage up until XX/XX/XXXX. My last payment accepted by Ocwen was in XX/XX/XXXX. I made a phone call to Ocwen on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX Central time. During that conversation I was transferred to the bankruptcy department. The purpose of my call was to discuss why I was unable to make a payment in XXXX both over the phone and on the internet. The customer service representative would not allow me to make a payment. He stated that because I had declared bankruptcy my loan was then transferred to the bankruptcy department which is why I was not allowed to make a payment. The CSR stated that Ocwen had not received my reaffirmation agreement from my bankruptcy attorney, advised me to contact my attorney, have my attorney fill out the reaffirmation agreement, and fax it to Ocwen. He stated this had to be done in order for Ocwen to start accepting payments. After much back and forth between my attorney and Ocwen I learned that the information your CSR gave me was incorrect and that I should have been able to make a payment. Due to this I fell behind on my mortgage and then unfortunately lost my job early XXXX of this year. By the time I had all the information from my attorney and Ocwen, Ocwen then would not accept any payments unless the behind balance was paid in full. I was told that since the account was greater than 90 days overdue they could not accept any amount of money except the full amount. This incorrect information created quite a problem for me. When I found out that the information this CSR gave me was incorrect from another Ocwen CSR I was told \\\" I \\'m sorry you were told the wrong information but they should have been able to take a payment, you were n\\'t speaking with a bankruptcy team expert. \\'\\' How in the world was I supposed to know that when I got transferred to the bankruptcy department that XXXX. I was n\\'t speaking with an expert and XXXX. That the information he was giving me was incorrect and that a payment should have been accepted!!!  \"\n",

I informed the representative that I am financial able to handle the note and did n\\'t need to modify the payment. After talking to several representives they infirmed me that after the modification my ex name would be removed. While going through the process of modifing the loan. I was working with XXXX XXXX, who also informed me thay after modifying the loan my ex name would be removed. She also informed me to do a Quit Claim Deed.The following day I went down to court house and was informed that my ex had to file the Quit Claim Deed. I informed her of what I was told my the courts and she infirmed me to do the modification and his name would be removed. I did the modification to only find out that his name was not removed. I spoke with XXXX on several occations about this and she informed me to wait one year and do an assumption. I waited the year it and apply for the assumption and was denied. I called Bank of America and spoke to XXXX, XXXXr in the assumptions department. He apologized for the information that was relayed to me and informed that that under normal circumstances it will take one year for and assumption to take place ; but because of my situation I have to wait 2-4 years because I should \\'ve assumed the loan and not modified it. I informed him that I did wait Bank of America representive told me to do to remove my ex name. Still it was n\\'t anything that he could do to help.  \"\n",

I had made an error in setting up my automatic loan re-payment information and inadvertently missed a payment. This triggered a {$20.00} late fee in my account. No problem with that. However, when looking at my statement, I noticed that the line item that added the {$20.00} late fee also incurred a {$.00} cent interest in the same monthly bill. I think that is wrong and hopefully just a \\\" programming error \\'\\' and not an INTENTIONAL act to XXXX money from consumers. Please look into it and either explain this action or ask Wells Fargo to change their practice. I made a personal complaint when I called to ask for a one time waver of the Late Fee. They did grant me that waver but did not say anything about this OUTRAGEOUS interest gouging practice. XXXX multiplied by XXXX is a lot of money.  \"\n",

In XXXX XXXX Bank of America advertised the property for sale for cash only through XXXX, agent XXXX Bank of America sold the property to a XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$130000.00} cash and closed on the property on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. For Bank of America to have now claimed that that same account was a part of a Bankruptcy on XXXX XXXX, XXXX is the highest form of FRAUD and has cause me irreputable Economic, mental Anguish, damage that one can not recover from.  I demand that Bank Of America make restitution, be Sanctioned, be fined and must pay damages to the maximum allowed to XXXX XXXX.  This was the most blatant rapping of a property from it \\'s owner imaginable. First of all Recntrust changed my name on the tax records in XXXX of XXXX, of which they had no authority to do so and without any notice to the owner.

Bank of America was contacted and they said that the XXXX XXXX bought the property for {$160000.00}. In the meanwhile that very day Bank of America claim to have recorded the sale for {$160000.00} reported to the IRS that very day and in addition, that the property was \\\" ABANDONED. \\'\\' Documented proof from Title and Escrow to verify above stated information.

I am a senior citizen, these are the people that Bank of America and XXXX and XXXX prey upon to suck the life out of and cause them economic bankruptcy and leave people destitute.

       "         value: \"My loan holder is Navient, formerly XXXX XXXX. My account number is XXXX. I have several types of federal and private loans with them as I have loans from XXXX my time as an undergraduate and as a XXXX student. When I initially graduated XXXX school my loan payments were roughly {$2000.00} a month. I was able to pause payments while I looked for employment. Since finding employment some seven months after graduation, I have made a steady {$60000.00} a year. Upon beginning employment, I asked Navient if I had options for income-based payments. They told me to fill out an application for Income Based and Income Contingent payments and to select that I want Navient to choose whichever is the best option for me. I complied ( through some effort because there was an issue processing my application ) and eventually my payments went down to {$1500.00}. However, after speaking with a fellow attorney who had more total debt than I did and made the same exact salary, I was worried something had gone wrong because where he was only paying {$300.00} a month I was paying {$1500.00}. I called Navient and asked them to look into this and I was informed that they had done something wrong with my application and my payments should actually be lower. However, my payments were only lowered to {$1000.00} a month. I asked if there was any other way to lower my payments as I literally can not afford to move out of my father \\'s house on this salary and am struggling to make the payments and was told that because of the way my loans were \\\" grouped \\'\\' there was nothing that could be done. I have been making the payments at {$1000.00} a month but it really is an unbearable imposition. I can not afford to live on my own when paying {$1000.00} a month for my student loans on top of all the other financial responsibilities I have. Furthermore, most attorneys I speak to are shocked that I pay so much more than they do in comparable circumstances. I want to make sure that the amount I pay really is the fairest amount and that I am not being taken advantage of by Navient. In spite of my continued efforts I still find myself drowning in these payments. Thank you for your time.  \"\n",

She stated that she had received my inquiry for a request for a Home Modification.She then verified my loan number contact info and asked me to verify my request which I did. I told her and she confirmed that the present foreclosure date was XXXX/XXXX/15. She then stated that it would take a day or XXXX maybe for the post phonement date. She also stated that I would have a new primary point of contact to process my request and that would take a day or XXXX to complete. I asked before the call ended did we have time and she said yes we have \\'\\' plenty of time \\'\\' between now and Monday. I then thanked her for her call.She gave me her contact information, At no time during our conversation did she indicate a problem or an approval from the foreclosure department about the sale date. To the best f my knowledge at that time she did not mention the CFPB complaint that I filed. I had also sent a request to XXXX XXXX, PA whom Wells Fargo had designated asa point of contact.  A few minutes later I received a call from XXXX from XXXX with whom I had filled out a hardship application. He stated that Wells Fargo was the hardest lender to work with and that in his opinion form the documentation that I submitted that we had a good chance to qualify for a modification. I told him that Wells Fargo had just called and that the sale date was to be post phoned. I thanked him for his time.  On Friday XXXX XXXX at XXXX I called her since I had no heard anything to check the status. She then gave new primary contact contact was to be XXXX XXXX who would contact me. At this time she indicated that she was responding to my CFPB complaint. XXXX t.hen called me at XXXX in the afternoon on XXXX XXXX He informed that Wells Fargo would not post phone the sale date and they would respond to my complaint. I was in complete shock when he said this. He had me if I had any questions and I told him that I was mislead by yprevious conversations.   The Wells Fargo employees were professional and polite. HOWEVER I WAS MISINFORMED by XXXX and she did not explain. THe consequences of this is that I lost XXXX hours of critical timing and the opportunity to work with a XXXX party.

Also I have been with XXXX Capital One, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX and XXXX XXXX since XXXX. My creditors have refused to send me and audited statement from when I first opened the account from XXXX until present, of how many times that I actually used the card and fees and interest added to the account. Then I want to read the numbers and see if my creditors have charged me for cash advance s balance transfers fees etc. The only thing the creditors say is that the account is fine which is a lie from XXXX and send me a few statements from the year XXXX. I am not paying back {$20000.00} dollars.I have called and spoken to staff XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and Mgment from Capital One about the problems of fees and interest with no solutions.  Do not close down your account unless you want your credit score to go down on your credit report. The creditors will not tell you this information.

This is when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had finally responded to my request. Capital One XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX have XXXX have lowered my credit limit and constantly charging me for items not purchased and adding on all kinds of fees to the account. I am not giving my creditors any more money until the the balances are much lower or disappear and I get my audited statements and do my own investigation.

       "         value: \"My father died in XX/XX/XXXX. Left me his only son all his belongings, he was also single.  My mother, his ex wife since XX/XX/XXXX, and he remained friends and she stayed with him in his house his last XXXX years of his life to help care for him. My mother, unknown to me at the time, was presenting herself to al of my father \\'s creditors as his \\\" wife \\'\\'. My father right before his death made it clear to me he was not agreeable to being presented to anyone as husband and wife regarding my mother for any reason.  Upon the time of my father \\'s death me and my family were living in a leased home. My mother qualified and received my fathers social security since they had been married XXXX years ( XXXX ). She stayed in the house and made the payment until I and my family were able to complete our lease on our home and move into my father \\'s home, as he and we wanted. I completed a probate since my father had no will and was single.  My mother moved out of the home and I started taking over the payments. Then I was laid off work. When I initally contacted the mortgage company they informed me they were unable to speak to me because in their records they had that XXXX XXXX ( my mother ) was the righful owner of the house since my father passed. I had to explain she was not his wife. I sent them all the correlative documents. I asked for a deferrment of a payment, they said no because i was not the mortgage holder. Next they started transferring my account to different locations of their \\\" servicing centers \\'\\' and each time I would go through the whole explanation of who I was and have to send the documentation again. All the while sending the documentation to their corporate office and speaking with them. At XXXX point I set up auto withdrawal, they would do that. The XXXX XXXX did n\\'t go through my account because their system wanted to withdraw at XXXX and my salary did n\\'t deposit into my account until XXXX XXXX. At this point they would n\\'t take a check from me. All the while I am requesting a modification of the loan. Each time my account was transferred to a new \\\" servicing center \\'\\' their employee would tell me to send a voided check and signature to authorize automatic withdrawal and I did each time. They never set it up. So in fear of the automatica withdraw suddently going into effect I refused to send more payments until someone would agree to something. They never would.  I just want to keep the house. Now that I have found the 12 CFR Part 1026 RIN 3170-ZA00 Application of REgulation Z \\'s Ability to Repay Rule to Certain Situations involving Successors in Interest, I believe the mortgage company violated this rule. I made it clear to the mortgage company I had every intention of keeping the home and paying the mortgage. Now they have filed foreclosure. This rule really hit home with me when I read it, because talking to several different people with Citifiancial I had some ask me why I did n\\'t ask for a modification and then others tell me that a modification was n\\'t possible! It appears it was all along.  Lastly, my wife ( XXXX XXXX ) and I have Power of Attorneys on each other and she has permission to speak to anyone regarding anything pertaining to these matters.  I am attaching the foreclosure petition and our answer, death cert, probate, power of attorneys and correspondence i have had with the mortgage company.  \"\n",

There had been some previous fraud activity by a XXXX relative on my account, so I added extra security measures by requiring a verbal password every time changes were to be made on my accounts. The bank recently on XXXX XXXX, 2015 allowed this person to close my account, open a new account with my money, and also withdraw money. This person was also allowed to claim many of my purchases as fraud in an attempt to get more money. I found out about the incident when I tried to use my bank card to pay for parking and it was declined. I called customer service to see what the problem was, only to be told that they could not help me unless I had the fraud claim reference number ( the report which I did not file ). The bank did not follow any protocol by asking for the verbal password. Instead, I was left unable to have access to my money until I was able to go into a branch and prove my identity. After the bank verified that this was a false fraud claim, the bank still moved forward with honoring the claim. Many of the purchases, which included personal bills and other business expenses, were returned to the bank. This reversal of payment caused me to incur canceled check fees, shut-off notices, and I had to buy my XXXX back since the hosting service was XXXX of the purchases filed on the false fraud claim. I had to repay all of those bills with my own money to avoid more fees and to keep my utilities in service. Later, the bank gave me a credit of {$1300.00} which was part of the amount filed as fraud. I went into a branch to verify what the credit was for, and I was told that this was my money because the bank realized that they made a mistake. The bank ended up taking the credit back from me, leaving my account negative over {$1100.00}. The bank said that they took the credit back because they realized that I was the one who made the purchases and that they could not honor my claim. The credit was not listed as a temporary credit ( as they usually list it as temporary until they finish the investigation ). I explained to them that I was not the one who made the claim and that I was told that the credit was given to me because of the money that had already been returned to the bank from the merchants. It then became a problem with miscommunication because none of the bank \\'s departments understood what was going on even after I explained it to them many times. The problem is that now, I still dont have the money that the bank took from the merchants, nor do I have the credit they gave me. When the person filed the false claim, they also were allowed to withdraw cash, which the bank did not honor. So I am out of all of this money and the bank has not lost anything. They are refusing to take responsibility for their mistake. They gave this person all of my personal information including print-outs of my purchases, documentation stating the password on my account, my business contacts, and a lot of other sensitive information. Wells Fargo should be held accountable for this breach in security.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"I have been having health issues and while I, XXXX XXXX, was in the hospital XXXX bank charged-off my loan to a XXXX-party debt collector. SRA in Hi-XXXX, NJ on XXXX/XXXX/2015. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 my Co-Signer received a call regarding the loan and was offered a XXXX settlement. I then called back to get information about the loan and physical address of the agency when the Manager XXXX XXXX, kept talking in circles telling me I was only allowed to have the physical address if I was disputing the Debt. At this point I had not even received a validation of debt letter and asked for said letter as well as a breakdown of my balance, I was interrupted multiple times as well as I was told I MUST make a payment within the month of XXXX, which does n\\'t even give me a full 30 days to receive the information to even dispute of part of the balance since I did n\\'t know how a XXXX loan that I was previously paying before I got sick, became {$26000.00}. The agent I spoke to previously to manager could n\\'t tell me what the interst rate was either, stating that it was \\\" about {$3.00} \\'\\' per day. The agent, XXXX XXXX, was n\\'t able to offer me a payment plan option either. When i spoke to the manager I was only offered the balance over 6 months ( about XXXX ) each month or a settlement of XXXX. Refusing to be upright and honest about what my options even were and leaving me more confused than when the conversation started. I also asked that they did not call the cell phones on the account but he refused to even tell me the cell contact numbers he had, instead i stated the only good contact number for me and the co-signer was the landline XXXX. I was under the impression i was going to be dealing with the creditor XXXX about this who i was trying to work with for payments and now i feel even more hopeless because this collection agency wo n\\'t be upfront with me.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"To Whom It May Concern, I have been fighting Wells Fargo for years in regards to a foreclosure on my property. They do n\\'t seem to believe they need to adhere to the laws of California or the guidelines, rules, and regulations that pertain to them. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I mailed to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, my servicer, a Notice of Rescission to cancel my loan transaction. It came to my attention recently that the opportunity to send a notice of rescission to them was still available because consummation of my loan had not yet occurred. Pursuant to the Federal Truth In Lending Act, hereinafter referred to as TILA, the notice of rescission is effective upon mailing. It automatically cancels out my deed of trust and the liability. To my understanding, under the statute, the promissory note and lien becomes automatically void by operation of law.  I mailed out the notice of rescission to Wells Fargo on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Wells Fargo received the notice on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Pursuant to TILA, Wells Fargo had twenty ( 20 ) calendar days from receiving the notice to either file a declaratory action against me to challenge the notice of rescission or to take the mandatory steps required under TILA. Wells Fargo did neither. The only thing Wells Fargo did was send me a letter stating they received my letter. Pursuant to TILA, the security interest is void and of no legal effect irrespective of whether the creditor makes any affirmative response to the notice. There is nothing in the statute that gives Wells Fargo the right or authority to grant or deny my notice of rescission. Had they disagreed with my notice of rescission, they were suppose to file a declaratory action against me within twenty ( 20 ) days to challenge my right to rescind. Wells Fargo or my \\\" true creditor \\'\\' failed to take those actions. Wells Fargo or my \\\" true creditor \\'\\' are in violation of TILA because they have failed to take the mandatory steps required under TILA. The statute makes no distinction between my right to rescind in 3-day or extended as neither cases nor statute give courts equitable discretion to alter TILA \\'s substantive provisions. Since Wells Fargo or my \\\" true creditor \\'\\' has failed to file a lawsuit challenging the rescission within the statutory 20 calendar period, they have given up any and all affirmative defenses to the rescission and they have no right or standing to attempt to enforce the deed of trust. I am puzzled as to who they believe they can proceed with a foreclosure on a deed of trust that has been canceled and made null and void by operation of law. There is absolutely no question that by operation of law my deed of trust has been canceled. Wells Fargo or my \\\" true creditor \\'\\' is in violation of TILA for their failure to comply with the statute within 20 calendar days. Thus, they have given up their right to make a claim for the money that was allegedly loaned to me. The debt is not only unsecured but it is eradicated starting with the rescission notice and ending with their failure to comply with the statute.  \"\n",

I may have tossed previous letters thinking they were junk mail refinance offers. I tried to log onto my previous servicer \\'s website to make payments several times XXXX through XXXX.  I called Nationstar as soon as receiving the letter and stated I could make payments but wanted verification that they had the note and did indeed own my debt. They said they would send it and never did. I forgot to call them back until XXXX XXXX, asking about the note. They said they could e-mail it, leaving me wondering why they had n\\'t done that before. They also said they had initiated foreclosure that day. I offered to pay the outstanding payments in full, but they said they would have to determine legal fees. Despite calling on the very day they initiated foreclosure, they called back a few days later and demanded {$900.00} of legal fees. I contacted their law firm and was mailed a letter saying no attorney had reviewed my account.  I spent many hours on the phone attempting to get them to reduce the fees. They tried to force me to apply for a modification that would involve a new XXXX-year mortgage that would end up costing me a lot more in the long run. I considered hiring a lawyer and taking them to court, but it seemed like too much risk. I finally gave up and was forced to pay the exorbitant fees.  In sum, my complaints : They foreclosed on my loan less than a month after I was notified that they owned the loan, and without providing me documentation of the note. My previous payments were not considered late until the XXXX of the month, yet they foreclosed before the XXXX. They claimed I owed {$900.00} in legal fees despite the fact that I attempted to pay in full within hours of them \\\" initiating foreclosure \\'\\' - and I had previously expressed willingness and ability to pay in full on XXXX XXXX. I was only 4 months behind in the XXXX place because I could n\\'t figure out why my previous lender was n\\'t accepting payments XXXX - XXXX.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"Over the past month I have written many complaints against Key Bank. I am writing this last complaint to simply sum up the issues that I have with this bank. I hope that the bank will be audited for excessive overdrafting again in the future. I had XXXX accounts with Key Bank, a personal checking account and a Hassle Free account. The Hassle Free account was attached to my personal checking account as an account that my teenaged son could use. He is a XXXX since he was just turning XXXX. The Hassle Free account issued a debit card with his name and I was able to transfer funds from my account to his account easily. Often, I would get very close to a XXXX balance as I live pay check to paycheck. Often I would deposit money through an ATM machine which would theoretically give me access to XXXX dollars immediately. However, through Key Bank \\'s magical accounting system, when the ledger would be managed by the bank, items would bounce because actually there was not immediate access to the money through the on line account.   I have several copies of my account and my son \\'s account as the bank was performing its processing during the evening and night hours. Often, the ledger shows a huge negative balance while the processing is happening. It \\'s hard to understand how a large modern bank like this has such antiquated accounting processes. I have an account in another bank and all transactions are immediate and neat. There is no messy, convoluted, unclear and dishonest practice that results in excessive overdrafts.   Anyway, the result of my complaining was that Key Bank closed my checking account. I did not ask for this. This created complete havoc in my financial life. I had to stop direct deposits and go to another bank to open an account for me and my son. When I talked to XXXX the representative of Key Bank who closed my account she did not even understand that the Hassle Free Account was my son \\'s and was connected to my personal account. She was going to leave the Hassle Free account open. So not only does key bank participate in magical accounting that results in excessive overdrafts for folks, but key bank also does not pay attention to its costumers and participates in retribution.   Lastly, for the years that I was involved with this bank, items would sit in the pending section of the account. Sometimes items would sit there for 10 days. But since Key Bank decided to close my account, items cleared within one day, even those items that were charged against the account by my son who is in another city. This shows that Key Bank purposefully leaves items in pending after which they reorder the debits to put the account in negative status.   I know that my complaining as I have could make me seem crazy and also that folks could argue that I do not manage my money well. But I represent many people who have no assets and who live pay check to pay check. This bank is notorious for these practices that I have highlighted over the last two months. I hope that at some point, Key Bank will be held accountable for their dishonesty and poor customer service. In the last year, I have paid the good part of XXXX $ in over draft fees. I do not have that money to give to Key Bank. XXXX the customer service rep said that she valued my patronage. Well, if that were true, then I would have had the overdraft fees refunded to me as I requested and Key Bank would not have tried to punish me by closing my account.  \"\n",

I could barely afford the deffered payment of {$20.00} a month already so I called a few times to see what was the increase for but never recieved a response or call back.

I began this process knowing that I would be laid off in a few months and wanted to get it started as I stated in my original affidavit to CCO Mortgage. I submitted all the paperwork requested within a timely matter. The initial process letter stated that if I supplied all that was needed in the allotted time the process should take no more than XXXX days. It has been XXXX months and I have still have not finalized my loan modification. Throughout these last XXXX months I have had to call my relationship manager over and over again. My constant complaint is not getting any information about what programs for which I would be considered. No one at the bank would tell me about any of the programs or how long the process would take. It was not until I received the letter saying I declined the modification that I saw the list. To this day, no one will tell me what those programs are or if I ever qualified. It is near impossible to get your relationship manager over the phone. When they do decide to get back to you, they leave no message. If you do manage to catch one of those early morning or late Friday afternoon calls its only to tell you they will call you again.When I finally did catch someone the last week of XXXX of 2015, I was told I was approved for a modification for 4 %, instead of my 4.875 %. I still had yet to the acceptance paperwork which I was told was mailed. I told the representative at that time I had been laid off. She took it on her own accord to throw out my modification acceptance without as much as a word to me. XXXX weeks later I received a letter dated XXXX XXXX, but was not mailed until XXXX XXXX in the mail stating my modification was declined because I did not accept the agreement. This was a flat out lie. By the time the paperwork came, it was too late to appeal by mail because it was mailed over XXXX days after being generated and only XXXX days were given on the notice. I immediately called letting them know this was a terrible error and the representative they had no right to do that especially since she was not my relationship manager. I was told they would reopen the case and the first payment would be due on XXXX XXXX, where I would be contacted to make the new payment over the phone because that was the only way. Of course when XXXX XXXX, 2015 came I did not receive any phone call. I called XXXX times, after XXXX hours I spoke to the representative who said they were going to call me and she quickly denied everything and they told me I would have to start all over again with the process. I told them no, they were at fault not me and they were doing this on purpose trying to force me into foreclosure with this so called process. Finally they took the payment over the phone and said someone would contact me when the paperwork was mailed. No surprise I did not get a call, I had to call my relationship manager again where I was told it would be sent XXXX. Again the document date was XXXX XXXX, 2015 and I did not receive it until XXXX XXXX, 2015 and FedEx overnight back on the XXXX of XXXX. I was sent 3 copies and was told by my relationship manager that only 2 copies were needed. I missed a phone call this morning, XXXX XXXX, 2015, which no message was left and phoned back to inquire about the missed call. My relationship manager said the paperwork had to be resent because XXXX paper was n\\'t signed and XXXX had a different date. I asked why they could not use the XXXX sets that were signed and dated properly and she did not have an answer. I also told her that my account in showing delinquent due to this long process even though I was making the payments directly to them. Now my credit would be affected it this process did not speed up because I was unemployed now. I can not afford a mortgage delinquency on my credit report.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"I have been a victim of fraud. On XXXX I notified SunTrust that I had some items on my account that I did not authorize and also noticed that I no longer had my card. I advised them that I last used my bankcard on XXXX at XXXX just to purchase a couple of items. I was told to submit an affidavit for the items that I was disputing and was told that I will have a decision within XXXX business days. I contacted them several times within the XXXX business days to get updates. They came back with the decision and stated that they saw no fraud was made against my account because my pin number was used. I told them I had just recently received that new card in the mail and no one had the PIN other than me. Some of the fraud was made using a XXXX ATM. I went to the branch location where the fraud was done and asked if I can review the video from the camera and I was told that they had no way of showing me. I asked if the video was even reviewed and they could never give an answer which makes me think that it might be a SunTrust employee that is associated with the fraud. I was told by the SunTrust employee that I would have to do my own investigation and submit more proof to them. The associated advised me to go to XXXX to request the tapes to be pulled, which I did, and was told that they do n\\'t have the authority to show me and video surveillance and can only be requested from the bank institution or an investigator. I also asked if a signature card was pulled to prove that the signatures on the back of the check did not match my signature but once again my request went unheard. I am requesting a full refund of all of the fraudulent items including the fees and a FULL investigation from SunTrust in house because I feel that SunTrust has frauded me and is possibly frauding other SunTrust members. The items that I am disputing are 2 checking that was deposited into the ATM one for {$910.00} and {$930.00}. There also was an ATM withdrawal for {$500.00} and 5 Wal-Mart purchases totaling {$260.00}. Also I have been a LOYAL customer with SunTrust bank for over 10 years and my account has ALWAYS been in good standings. I used this account for all of my personal banking needs such as receiving my direct deposit from my employer and paying bills. I have also incurred late fees because I am unable to pay my bills due to the fraud on my account.  \"\n",

As of XXXX XXXX i disputed the value since it did n\\'t make any sense that the value increased almost {$200000.00} in just a few months.   Select Portfolio Servicing refuse to take the report that i prepared for them to dispute the value, i spoke to a manager from the ombudsman dept. who told me that in order to dispute the value i will have to pay for an appraisal out my pocket.  So i did, i paid for a Licensed appraisal to go out to my home and confirm the value, a few days later i received the full report showing that the value was {$400000.00}.   Now Select Portfolio Servicing is refusing to use the Appraisal that Select Portfolio Servicing forced me to pay for in order to dispute the value, i requested for a manager since this is ridiculous that they keep providing me with misleading information and now they just refuse to help me avoid foreclosure.

The person on other line told me he \\'d have to check with supervisor since its for the total amount due and not the smaller amounts I normally paid. I explained I was paying it all off, etc., and he was still very hesitant and sketchy about it.  I finally got the payment made after taking about an hour, much longer than normal. He gave me confirmation number and we went about our days.  I received statement from Fifth & Third a few days later on like XX/XX/XXXX or so, showing the payment being made, and account balance being {$0.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX  Therefore I assumed there was no issue with payment, and planned to not pay any attention to account anymore since it was paid off ...  This week on XX/XX/XXXX, I received XXXX letters from 5th and 3rd, XXXX I opened first showing that my credit card with them is now cancelled due to delinquent payments, the other letter being a new statement showing a new balance of {$1400.00}!!!  I looked closer at statement and it has Payment Reversal happening on XX/XX/XXXX!  I checked my bank account and sure enough payment is no longer there.  I \\'ve called them and asked why it was reversed, they informed me it \\'s because the account number was n\\'t taken right that day!!!  I never received any letter, call, or email telling me that the payment was reversed, and was under the impression that the {$1400.00} was out of my bank account and that the bill was paid off due to the statement they mailed me showing it was paid!!! ( I was n\\'t concerned with checking my bank account at the time, as I had {$25000.00} in it to pay off bills and purchase a tractor, was no reason for me to look for that charge, it should \\'ve gone through.. ) When that employee didnt correctly complete my payment, they still sent out a XXXX balance statement, and when the error was caught, never informed me so technically, I did n\\'t pay XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX \\'s bill because I had no clue I even had a balance with them!!  I received XX/XX/XXXX the statement showing me all this so they left me in the dark, and have now screwed up my credit report!  They \\'ve reported this as XXXX month delinquent account now, even though it was their fault for not informing me of THEIR mistake!!  I understand whats happened and realize I \\'ll be paying the {$1400.00} now asap ( I bought my tractor just last week so all that money is gone, and I thought this was already paid off so now put me in the hole!! ).  However, I need them to rectify my credit report and take off these false claims of a delinquent account the past XXXX month!!  I \\'ve received XXXX letters from XXXX other credit cards I had this week, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, both of which are fully paid off, and they just lowered my credit line by a total off {$12000.00}!!! I just lost that much credit cause of 5th and 3rds stupid mistake with my payment and failure to notify me!  They falsely informed me that the account was paid and good, and failed to inform me of their mistake all while XXXX up my credit I \\'ve worked hard to build and need in the future!!  I \\'ve gotten no where on the phone to remedy this and need help to talk to someone who will actually help!!  Please help, every day they ruin my credit even more!  \"\n",

       "         value: \"1. There has been a Wells-Fargo failure to have selected and facilitated a purchaser of the past due debt on a Wells-Fargo Credit Card ( i.e., a card ending in # XXXX, that was purchased by a firm named Investment Retrievers ) to be a firm that can be relied upon to comply with the 7-year maximum Federal Law to timely correct a defaulted ( \\\" charge-off \\'\\' ) credit card debt reporting error in this complainant \\'s personal XXXX credit report. ( More specifically, this erroneous credit report listing by XXXX XXXX relates to XXXX. account beginning with # XXXX. ) This failure to remove a major negative in the credit report of this complainant after the 84th month ( i.e., after 7 years ) has continued beyond the 30-day period following XX/XX/XXXX - the date this complainant phoned in this error to XXXX and created Dispute file # XXXX. More specifically, the error is in the XXXX removal date - where XXXX has not deleted this negative from this complainant \\'s XXXX report after the end date of the 84th month - the date of XX/XX/XXXX in this case ( in contradiction with the facts I provided in this complainant \\'s phone call to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and via Faxed documents on the same date ). Apparently XXXX and XXXX XXXX did not verify the 7-year end-date to the XXXX late fee transaction posted ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) in the records of the original creditor for this debt - Wells Fargo Bank.   2. Investment Retrievers is a debt purchaser. The original Wells-Fargo credit card for this debt ended in the acct # XXXX.   3. The specific documentation of this XXXX late fee date ( of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) is attached to this complaint. All of the documentation for correcting this complaint error is described in a multi-page letter filed with this 4th CFPB complaint. Also provided with that letter are a number of documents, including ( a ) the recent Complainant \\'s XXXX credit report page that includes this error, ( b ) copies of an XXXX Invalid Dispute reply that fails to correct their error, i.e., a reply that ignores the documentation this complainant provided that irrefutably supports this complainant \\'s corrections, and ( c ) copies of the creditor \\'s contemporaneous monthly statement postings of the XXXX late fees to prove and correct this error using the books of the company that incurred these charges - this complainant \\'s employer. The attached letter also explains how these debts are all company debts and that none are personal ( non-business ) charges made by this complainant. This complainant is losing income because the major credit report negatives that remain in this complainant \\'s credit reports are preventing this complainant from successfully pursuing and securing a financial manager - or other trusted position - in the job market.   4. This complainant \\'s lost income damages are also detailed in the attached letter. In summary, these damages are $ XXXX per week-day, as this complainant is a victim of fraud and as such, this complainant \\'s state law specifies treble damages. The damages resulting from the 7-year end date credit report errors began on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX in the case of this 2nd CFPB complaint involving the XXXX XXXX purchased Wells-Fargo credit card ending in # XXXX ( major negative ) still in this complainant \\'s report after that date by XXXX.  \"\n",

I never opened this account, I never signed any agreement with the creditor, now I \\'m having issues trying to buy a house because Equifax is reporting incorrect information and the creditor is illegally reporting this account as mine. Please delete this account from my Equifax credit report.  \"\n",

I was told in writing by XXXX XXXX if I did n\\'t sign it they would not let me make any more pre payments to my sub loan. ( this is in my contract that I can make any prepayments with no penalty ) .so I would n\\'t have any problems later, I signed this for the XXXX time. they also brought me a paper to sign to get an EIN # I am XXXX yrs old and do n\\'t know why I would need this but I signed it anyway. I was also told in writing that I would receive a check for {$500.00} for my trouble which I never got. Now they are calling my home everyday asking me to do it again for the XXXX time. the bank calls my house everyday they went as far as to send a representative here last week with the same paperwork again which he left with my XXXX yr old grandson who said the representative took pictures of the front of my home. this is ridiculous I refused to be upset with this anymore and in turn the bank has now blocked my access to my online mortgage payment option. when I press to make a payment on my loan the screen reads that I am not able to use mortgage pay on the web at this time and gives me a phone # to call. when I call the number they tell me that I have to speak to my acct manager and I am sent to voice mail. this is a lot of aggravation for someone my age. in addition since the modification has been in effect in 2013 I have never missed a payment or been late and each month for at least a year I have been paying XXXX months at a time. I feel this is harassment and I would appreciate any help or advice you can offer.  \"\n",

Towards the end of our modification, our house was sold, although we had received papers from the court that they were giving us a date in court to stop the foreclosure sale that was suppose to happen the following week. Yet, our house was sold a week BEFORE the court hearing was suppose to take place and when all papers shows that the modification was taking place. I wrote to the court but they replied that hearing was final. I also appealed the courts final decision and the appeal was denied. I asked for a rehearing and that too was denied. Since the beginning I have tried to explain all the process to them. I haave sent and resent papers with proof of what I \\'m saying with very detailed explanation and it seems that it has fallen on deft ears from banks to courts to everyone. I found your article in XXXX magazine and decided to write to you about it as a last recourse. I still have hope everything can be undone. They had also told me that if I showed something had changed they would take it under consideration when we were still in the modification, but although I showed my husbad was now working nothing was taken into consideration and nothing changed.

       "         value: \"Summer of XX/XX/XXXX BOA talked us into a {$27000.00} HELOC ( home equity line of credit ). We were told there was a 10yr draw limit. I asked about what would happen at the end of 10 years. BOA said if there was a balance, it would be converted to a conventional XXXX mortgage. When the 10 years was up, and the draw period ended BOA again said I would be given XXXX of XXXX options ( depending on our financial situation ), being either a XXXX or 40 year XXXX mortgage. They sent paperwork for us to fill out and return, which we did. Problem is BOA repeatedly claimed we did not send them the paperwork. XXXX time BOA called and accused me of not responding ( sending them the forms ). When informed the BOA rep I had PROOF of faxing the forms & were received at the XXXX number given. Then she said I did not fill out \\\" line XXXX \\'\\', So how did she KNOW we did not fill out lineXXXX if they never got the forms? ( I later looked up my copy and discovered line XXXX was where a XXXX part was to send BOA the requested info, which I had no clue what BOA address the released info was to be sent ). The XXXX times instead of mailing or faxing, I drove over to the XXXX XXXX branch closest BOA after they closed the XXXX branch and delivered the forms. The XXXX time a BOA customer service lady went over the forms to make sure everything was in order. Even then BOA \\\" lost \\'\\' our paperwork hand delivered in person, not once but XXXX. I continued making payments on this HELOC just as I had been for the past 10 years as requested by BOA, and more.   My wife ( lost her job ) and had to go on XXXX XXXX Soc Sec XXXX ) and we had to use her meager retirement to bridge the income gap until her XXXX started.   ... ... ... What I have done over this past year, with the BOA mortgage modification pending, I have worked at reducing credit card balances to well under {$1000.00} total, to make us even more credit worthy. I have also, as funds permitted, paid down the HELOC principle from almost {$27000.00} XXXX the max ) to just under {$20000.00}. Even reducing our monthly debt load and substantially lowered the HELOC balance for the conversion XXXX either 15yr or 40 yr ) BOA promised back when we took out the loan and several times over this past 12 months.   & gt ; .... What BOA has done over the past 12 months, promises of a XXXX or 40 yr mortgage conversion, repeated request for forms THEY LOST??, reduced our credit limit on our {$4000.00} limit Platinum Plus Visa by nearly half to make it appear we were maxed out instead of about 50 % or just over {$2000.00}. XXXX Visa balance is now its a little over {$200.00} XXXX.  BOA LIES over and over again and uses bait and switch tactics, harassment and threats instead of acting as a responsible honest bank. I am now reverting to payments on the HELOC I agreed to & no more. I could pay this down another XXXX dollars IF given the mortgage conversion PROMISSED by BOA, because with BOA hanging foreclosure over our heads, I may need those XXXX to move by force from our home since XX/XX/XXXX.  All I have ever asked was to be treated fair & honest and for Bank of America to live up to its PROMISES.  PS I just recently started receiving VA XXXX benefits, currently at about $ XXXX ( which I plan to file a NOD appeal for a higher rate ) so our income has improved a little over last year.

Due to health issues I tried my best to settle this with Capital One but I was given the run around and clearly lied to more than once. I \\'ll begin by saying Capital One put me on some XXXX XXXX XXXX of theirs without my consent. The program consists of the customer making XXXX on time payments to their accounts of the minimum payment due in which I \\'ve made more than XXXX payments and I \\'ve paid much more than the minimum with each payment I \\'ve made since XX/XX/XXXX which is also when Capital One put me on their XXXX without me knowing. I was told when I make the last payment my credit limit would be increased to {$1000.00}. As I \\'ve stated I \\'ve made more than XXXX payments already yet Capital One has refused to increase my credit limit to the {$1000.00} credit line and it \\'s not right which makes me further consider not doing business with Capital One any longer because I have health issues and I do n\\'t need any stress from a company about something they promised me. On Tuesday XXXX I spoke to a Supervisor. He tells me my credit limit wo n\\'t be increased until XX/XX/XXXX. I told him that \\'s not right I have to wait until XXXX XXXX when I \\'ve made XXXX payments already. I also have proof regarding the higher credit limit offered by Capital One which I \\'ll include with my complaint.   I have medication that I pay for monthly that I intended to use my card for when the increase was done but now there is a chance I have to wait until XX/XX/XXXX just to pay for my medication and I should n\\'t have to wait that long. Capital One is the one that put me in their XXXX XXXX program because I \\'ve never heard of it until I called yet now they wo n\\'t Honor what they offered. Rather they are able to just add you to any of their programs or not they should send customers something a letter, by mail, or by email because it \\'s no way they can say they ca n\\'t contact any of their customers to at least let them know what is going on when anything is done with their accounts.  \"\n",

Today they say I owe {$23000.00} plus {$17000.00} past due. I took money out of my IRA to just keep up with mybills. I have had excellent credit my whole life, this has just been anightmare. They did change the mailing address so for six monthsI did not receive anything. It took they a year of me callingto correct the mailing address. this is a lot loan, no house is on the property.

Now this is showing up on my credit report as financial loss because they are putting it as a charge off. This makes no sense because at the time of closing my account, which I now see on the XXXX report I just received is due to \\\" suspected fraud activity \\'\\', I had money in there. They ended up sending me a check in the mail about a week or two after the fact because I had a balance they owed me from direct deposit going in from my paycheck. I am extremely angry because I do n\\'t know why they would even put suspected fraud activity when there is no reason to assume that. I had a bad history of overdraft but always resolved it and had a paycheck being direct deposited into the account every two weeks on the dot so there was no question that it would n\\'t get paid. In addition, it should n\\'t state that I was charged off because there was no negative balance at the time of the account closure, it was POSITIVE, hence them sending me the credit from the balance that was left in my account at the time. This is now hindering my credit and ability to open new accounts.  \"\n",

I will pull our bill and locate their number XXXX.   As of XXXX/XXXX/2015 this company has not signed for the return receipt in their PO Box which was available for pickup on XXXX/XXXX/2015 according to the USPS tracking website. I believe this is done to continue to harass consumers.   i have retained screenshots of the missed call log, the bills showing their calls, recorded conversations uploaded to the cloud, a copy of their letter as well as the envelope, the return receipt, screenshots of the USPS website for tracking and delivery, and a copy of the letter that I sent. I will obtain a copy of my credit report as well as I suspect they are in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act as well as the Fair Credit Reporting Act.   As such, this company is now harassing me for a debt they have yet to validate in any manner. They have broken multiple regulations in the FDCPA in an effort to harass me.  \"\n",

My now-deceased father had a reverse mortgage ; so, essentially, my daughter refinanced the home in her name. Throughout the process of my daughter obtaining a loan from her financial lender, the reverse mortgage company and it \\'s attorneys pursued foreclosure. During the process of attempting to take over the property and without the knowledge of the estate, the reverse mortgage company made a highly unusual payment of taxes on the property. As the personal representative over the estate, I also paid the taxes. I was later informed through the title company that the taxes were current through XXXX 2016 and that the overage would have to be settled on the day of closing. However, instead of the title company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX Maryland XXXX remitting a check due back to me as the seller on behalf of the estate, XXXX XXXX XXXX illegally credited the reverse mortgage company money including part of what the estate had paid. In an email message to the reverse mortgage company requesting the refund due to the estate, I copied the title company. The title company \\'s representative was very rude responding to the message. However, in her rude response, she states that the money is/was due to the seller. XXXX XXXX in representing XXXX XXXX XXXX used her position at the company to require my daughter to send money to XXXX XXXX in order to close on the desired property. She also used her position to illegally falsify documents in order to credit the reverse mortgage company and finally made an unauthorized wire of funds to the reverse mortgage company that was due to the seller/estate. The actions of XXXX XXXX Company and/or it \\'s representatives lead me to question how many times they have falsified documents in hope and anticipation of the seller and buyer \\'s lack of knowledge. Please address this current issue with XXXX XXXX Company. Additionally, an audit of their previous records and dealings should be conducted.  \"\n",

I have irrefutable proof, confirming a payment was not due on XXXX XXXX, 2015, ( attached ) and copies of my credit report, showing it has been reporting as XXXX late. I have written letters to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX disputing the 30 day late reporting for XXXX, 2015 However, and somewhat incredibly US Bank continues to verify that as accurate. I have an urgent need to update my report accurately as I am in the process of securing a large, XXXX XXXX dollar construction loan and as a result of the ( 30-day ) late account my interest will be increased costing me an additional {$17000.00} thousands dollars over the course of the loan.  Additionally, US BANK \\'s website was continually down in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/2015, not allowing me to make on line payments, and calling always had ureasonable long holds of over 10-15 minutes. Further, if you look at the XX/XX/2015 statement I have attached, it displays a balance of over {$5000.00} and the amount due as the same.

I have been a customer of CitiMortgage over 25 years.  The representative I spoke with told me of XXXX different types of refi.  Refi no money out would not require any appraisal Refi with cash out.. would require appraisal.  He gave me rate and fees on both. I advised him I would think about it and call back.  XX/XX/XXXX I called CitiMortgage back and spoke with a XXXX XXXX. I explained I wanted to lower my payments on my current mortgage. He again told me of the XXXX different methods ...  Refi no money out would not require any appraisal Refi with cash out.. would require appraisal.  When I told XXXX I did n\\'t know which way to go, he suggested I do the Refi with cash out. If I change my mind, I could always go the other route. I agreed to it.  Then we ran into a problem. The appraisal company and I had a disagreement ** and we were unable to complete the appraisal part of the loan. When I called CitiMortgage to advise them of the problem, I was told there was nothing they could do since they can not interfere with the 3rd party vendor. It was suggested I just withdraw the application and they would refund my XXXX XXXX paid for appraisal fees back. I was not happy.  I called XXXX XXXX and explained the problem. I told him lets go ahead and switch my application to a Refi with no cash out since that type of refi did not require an appraisal.  He said he would have to get back to me.  He called me a couple of days later and stated \\\" they \\'\\' changed their minds. \\\" They \\'\\' are now requesting an appraisal on the property after all ... ... even though taking no cash out.  I advised XXXX I have been told twice by XXXX different people ( XXXX being him ) that on a no cash out refi, an appraisal would not be required. He said I know, I will have to find out why they are saying that now and get back to you. ( I also have email trails ) I have heard nothing since ... even after several texts to XXXX inquiring.  I have a XXXX credit score ... so I know it \\'s not a credit issue I have had a loan with CitiMortgage for over 25 years with excellent pay history..so I know that \\'s not it.  Isnt this misrepresentation? Misleading? Providing untrue information? Or is it because : Is it because I am female?  Is it because I am older?  Is there now discrimination involved?  To change their mind after what I was first told by XXXX separate people? To the point that their own loan rep doesnt even know why?  I sent a complaint letter to CitiMortage on XXXX/XXXX/15. I received an acknowlegement they received. It would be reviewed and I would be advised. Never heard back.  I was also told I would get my $ $ back. They charged my credit card {$520.00} and TODAY, over a month later I get a letter that I will only get a credit of $ XXXX.back.  **appraisal issue : I have a home with XXXX XXXX acres. There is an old house at the end of the property that was build in the XXXX that is waiting to be torn down.. In the pass, CitiMortgage classified the old building as a \\\" outbuilding \\'\\' or a \\\" shed \\'\\' as it added no value to the property ( I have refinance twice before with Citi ). I have a nice XXXX story home with a huge barn/stables and a pool. Citi \\'s contracted appraisal vendor wants to inspect the old house and it has to pass inspection ... which it wo n\\'t ..Hence why I am going to tear it down. We could not come up with an agreement ...  I explained the situation to CitiMortgage ..reminding them I have been a customer of theirs for over 25 years and we have refinanced twice before with no issue. My loan balance is only {$120000.00} with property value ( without that old house ) well over that. They said nope ... .had to have appraisal.  Advised me to withdraw my cash out loan.  \"\n",

We have bills totaling over $ XXXX. The Care Credit card allows options for deferred interest if you pay within the promotional deadline. In multiple cases we selected 0 % for 12 months. Each month our bill provides the monthly balance, deferred interest, and when the promotional date expires.  My concern is deceitful and misleading payment processing.  For example : Charge # 1 - Expires XXXX/XXXX/XXXX with a balance of {$4000.00} Charge # 2 - Expires XXXX/XXXX/XXXX with a balance of {$5000.00} I will pay {$500.00} to charge # 1 to avoid interest. Care Credit is not applying the full payment to charge # 1. Instead they are applying portions of the payment as they see fit. A consumer paying {$500.00} naturally wants to pay down charge # 1. There is indication in their payment system that says otherwise. A consumer believes all of the {$500.00} payment is being applied to charge # 1.  Care Credit has been deceitfully spreading out the payments among the multiple charges, which then makes the consumer default into interest charges. This is not only wrong but a bold face lie since there is nothing indicating/differentiating payments to multiple charges.  We have never been late and always pay on time. I am angry because we have multiple charges we have been trying to pay off, only to see that Care Credit is lying to their customers about payment distribution.  We expect an inquiry to be made and restitution to all customers they have been cheating for a long time. I have no idea how many years we may have been paying interest believing we were paying our promotional balances on time.  Shame on you Care Credit for your deceitful practices!  \"\n",

I attempted XXXX times to enter my confirmation number, social security number and street address only to be told by an automated system that the information was incorrect. I then attempted to open up a new investigation only to go through the same process. They are also requesting that I have to manually send information via the mail in order to provide of identity so that they may investigate further. That is a ludicrous excuse to deny access and also respond to a formal complaint first submitted to the CFPB several weeks back. The credit bureau is attempting to place an extra burden upon consumer in order for their company to stall and not respond. I am unable to provide an attachment but have the official letter sent by Equifax on XXXX/XXXX/15 in which they attempt to defer response to the previous complaint and require me ( the consumer ) to provide additional information.

In 2015 your insurance was added to my account without my knowledge or authorization, resulting in monthly charges of XXXX, totally {$350.00} at present.  My husband, who is authorized to discuss my mortgage account but not make changes to it, attempted to make a claim, describing to your agent a sewer line problem in our house. After several weeks, your company was able to dispatch a plumber to our house who said the problem could not be addressed because the pipes were not \\\" accessible \\'\\', but still charged us {$85.00} for the visit.  My complaints are : 1 ) The insurance was added to my account without my request 2 ) When service was requested, it took 3 weeks to get a response 3 ) When response was made, a plumber was sent even though the condition was falls within the very broad and very subjective exclusions in your policy regarding \\\" inaccessibility \\'\\' of pipes, etc. As if the representative was aware that the issue was not covered, they listed the problem as a water line problem when it was clearly stated twice to be a sewer issue.  I request : 1 ) Immediately stop charging my Ditech account for the property at XXXX XXXX, VA XXXX 2 ) Refund of {$350.00} I was improperly charged for nearly fictitious insurance, which in any event was not available in a timely manner when it was requested 3 ) Refund of {$85.00} we paid as a result of the incorrect and deliberate dispatch of plumber for issues that were obviously not covered Were you ( or an external regulator ) to impose transparency and integrity on your practices, attention should be paid 1 ) how customers are signed up ( a signature or voice recording would be advisable ) ; 2 ) how exclusions are disclosed upon sign-up and upon service requests.  \"\n",

We were in a loan modification process with them when I was told that we had been denied. NationStar told us not to make any payments during this time frame as it would only XXXX up the process and would take more time to complete. I called Take XXXX XXXX, a credit counseling company, that I had been working with and asked, \\\" What do we do now? \\'\\' They said not to worry, the state of Arizona has a program for this scenario where they make up the past due amount and the loan resumes as if nothing had happened. We just needed something in writing from NationStar stating we had been denied.   I continued to call them every week to check the status of our property and the notification of the denial and to see if a sale date had been set yet. I kept getting told that things were \\\" On hold. \\'\\' In XX/XX/XXXX a woman came to our front door and said she was the new owner of our house. This came out of the blue with no notification at all. If we had received something in writing this would have all been averted. We never received a thing in writing from them. We were evicted!!!   I am realtor and just found out about your agency in a continuing education class this past week. Please help us, ASAP!! We are now in a rental and our landlords are also mortgaged with NationStar, they are in an interest only loan and want to refinance it at current interest rates but are being denied that option. Our landlords have told us they need to have something setup by the end of XXXX to allow us to stay here. I was recently hospitalized for XXXX, XXXX and a XXXX. I was involved in a XXXX car crash on the freeway shortly thereafter and have been under the care of a XXXX for XXXX and XXXX. Any move in the future would simply kill both of us. I am XXXX and my wife is XXXX.   We had owned the property in XXXX for 20 years. It was always kept in pristine condition and that is same way we are taking care of this home now.  \"\n",

The transfer was rough on the Nationstar side ( no communication and lack of reps that could see the transferred loan in their system ) but we did n\\'t miss a single payment. 6 months after buying our loan, Nationstar is advising we have negative escrow and want a {$5800.00} check now or a {$470.00} increase to our monthly mortgage payment for the next year. Problem is that we never had an escrow account with either XXXX XXXX or a new one with Nationstar. After sending it to their escrow research department XXXX times ( the first time the rep said he would log it but did n\\'t so their records only show XXXX attempts ), we get the same form letter with the same demands every time. Our choice now is to damage our credit or pay almost {$500.00} a month extra in mortgage for a debt that XXXX XXXX added to the end of our loan period.  Additionally, our mortgage was an ARM that could only be adjusted during the first XXXX quarters of the loan. That time limit has come and gone under the XXXX XXXX term. Now Nationstar feels they have the right to adjust the rate every 6 months over the remaining life of the loan which was never the terms of the original mortgage. How is our mortgage allowed to be sold and the new mortgage lender not follow the terms of the original mortgage? We have not entered into any subsequent or amended agreement with Nationstar and had no say in the matter when they purchased our loan from XXXX XXXX.  \"\n",

After I put in all my money bills in, the monitor showed that I deposited too many bills at one time, so the machine first spitted out my money back. When I about to go grab my cash back, the machine sucked all my money back in then the whole machine froze and not responding nor printed out any receipt. First, I waited in front of the ATM machine to see if it will return my money back. After waiting for about 10 min, I went into the bank and call for help. Chase bank sent a XXXX speaking lady to help me. Then this lady told me that this happen before that the machine could spit out the money in about 10 min, so the lady waited with me in front of the machine for about another 15 min. After the long wait, she sent me to the office and there was another customer service man helped me to place the phone call to Chase Claim department because, according to them, they are different department and they could n\\'t do anything for me besides place a phone call to Chase phone line. I spoke with a lady on the phone line and she told me that she will go ahead to put a CREDIT DUE TO ATM DEPOSIT DISPUTE of {$2800.00} to my checking account and they will take care of everything. On XXXX/XXXX/2015, a credit was placed in my checking account. I trusted Chase bank because I \\'ve been a customer with Chase for a long time. However, on XXXX/XXXX/2015, I checked my account statement online and found Chase posted a REVERSE CREDIT FOR ATM DEPOSIT DISPUTE of {$2800.00} to my checking account on XXXX/XXXX/2015, so I called Chase at XXXX right away and spoke with claim specialist XXXX at XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/2015, and found out the Chase could not locate extra cash on that ATM machine. I requested Chase to re-investigate my claim on XXXX/XXXX/2015. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 at XXXX, I went back to Chase bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Flushing XXXX NY XXXX ) and request to get additional help in person. I spoke with Officer Relationship Banker XXXX XXXX regarding my case again, then the answer I got was the same which they will re-investigate this case. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 at XXXX, I called Chase at XXXX and spoke with their claim specialist Preftom regarding update of my claim. The answer for Chase \\'s 2nd investigation was the same which they could not locate the money and I will never be able to get my {$2800.00} back. I questioned Chase 1 ). what if the ATM machine did spit out my money back later then someone took it? 2 ). Did the investigation team check the surveillance camera ( there are at least 4 cameras in each corner ) to see if any one took my money after I left because I was instructed by their employee that they will take care of everything? 3 ) If I could speak to the investigation team directly? After all, their answer was NO and there is nothing they can do at this point.  \"\n",

Upon contacting NBA, I was informed that all of their accounts had been suspended, and that we should have received an email in XXXX informing us of the situation. We had not received such an email. An NBA representative informed me that I should continue to make my mortgage payments to my financial institution on the normal bi-weekly schedule. I contacted the financial institution, and they said it was impossible to make bi-weekly payments to them. We would need to make XXXX payment per month, as before. Had this not came to our attention through our own personal accounting, we would have not known to send any payments to our mortgage lender, and would have ended up in default. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I discovered, through an internet search, that the CFPB had filed a federal lawsuit against NBA, due to their ongoing dishonest practices against their customers, like ourselves.. My wife and I are asking to be included in that lawsuit as a plaintive, and to be eligible for any and all compensation that may be due my wife and I as a result of the current court proceedings, as we too have been deceived by believing that we were \\\" ... saving thousands of dollars \\'\\', by allowing NBA to handle our mortgage payments.

       "         value: \"To Whom It May Concern, I have been fighting to save my home for the past few years with must frurstration. Recently, after doing some research, I discovered some facts about my mortgage loan that was very disturbing. After further research, I decided to exercise my right to rescind my loan. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I mailed Select Portfolio Servicing , Inc, herein SPS, a letter of rescission canceling my deed of trust and debt obligation. SPS received my letter of rescission on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Under the Federal Truth In Lending Act, herein TILA, the rescission is self-enforcing and it automatically extinguishes the lien and the liability. The statute and regulation specify that the security interest, promissory note or lien arising by operation of law on the the property becomes automatically void. I mailed the rescission to SPS because under TILA it states that delivering notification to the entity or address to which the consumer has been directed to send payments constitutes delivery to the creditor or assignees. Despite having received my letter of rescission, SPS has chosen to ignore, disregard, or deny my rescission request. I find this to be appalling because nothing in TILA gives them the right or authority to grant or deny my rescission. If SPS wanted to challenge my right to rescind, they should have filed a declaratory action against me before the mandatory statutory XXXX calendar window of opportunity expired. Not only did SPS choose not to challenge my rescission through the proper channels, they have not complied with the mandatory steps required upon receiving my letter of rescission. Since SPS or my actual \\\" creditor \\'\\' has failed to take the mandatory steps under TILA, they have given up any defense regarding my letter of rescission and is in violation of TILA. Since the rescission process is or is suppose to be self-enforcing, failure to comply with TILA subjects SPS and my actual \\\" creditor \\'\\' to liability for their non-compliance. Pursuant to TILA, there is no burden of proof for me to make the rescission effective, it is effective upon mailing. Furthermore, despite the fact that my deed of trust and debt obligation has now been canceled, rendered null and void by operation of law, SPS continues to attempt to foreclose on my property. I currently have a foreclosure sale date set for Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2015. I do not understand how SPS can ignore the law and attempt to proceed with a foreclosure on a deed of trust that no longer exists. Pursuant to TILA, upon the mailing of my letter of rescission and if no lawsuit against me was filed within 20 days to challenge the rescission, the creditor \\'s interest in my property was automatically negated regardless of its status and whether or not it was recorded or perfected. The security interest is void and of no legal effect irrespective of whether SPS or the creditor made any affirmative response to the note. SPS and the creditor should be held accountable for their actions or the lack thereof. Any and all foreclosure action against my property should be canceled immediately. I feel it is my duty to report their behavior and their blatant disregard for the law to whatever authority regulates them. Their behavior is unacceptable.  Thank you, XXXX XXXX XXXX  \"\n",

So, I stated I wanted to cash the entire check and take the cash. He then stated, \\\" that was not possible. Wells Fargo requires a 3 day notice for cashing such a large amount ( XXXX ). I asked him to wave the fee ( as they always did ), he again stated very hostilely, I will wave it today, for the last time. I really do n\\'t think I need to put up with such poor attitudes and lack of employee \\'s knowing banking policies. I did however receive excellent service from XXXX. What she did n\\'t know, she kindly stated that and politely found out the correct information. I have never, never received such poor service from this particular branch. In the future if XXXX XXXX is out, another person besides XXXX need to cover as a Manager. Their are other qualified and professional staff members that can maintain excellent customer service. There was no one to greet the customers and I sat for XXXX min. before I reached out for someone for help. XXXX XXXX XXXX walked right by me and placed another customer before me. That is when I spoke up. I will not be returning to this branch. As soon as my check clear I will be closing my account at Wells Fargo for the last time.  \"\n",

I answered the call, but there was no response and then I was hung up on. I called immediately back, and was quickly connected to a representative. I was asked to verify my account, and I gave them my name, and my address, but then they asked for ANOTHER piece of information to verify ( for XXXX purposes ). I questioned this, because they originally called me, threby meaning they would have to do outbound XXXX requirements.  They started to argue with me, and I never provided the additional information because I was mad, and because they started to argue with me about the process. While this was going on, the rep started to talk about the specifics of my loan, the fact that I was overdue, and that he needed to collect payment at that very moment because there is no grace period on the note. It states right inside the note that there is a 15 day grace period before it is considered late and collection proceedings are started.  The thing that blows my mind about this is the fact that I had already sent out a payment automatically from my Bank account on Friday afternoon! It was removed from my checking account, and was waiting on Credit Acceptance to process it! However, they chose to have a representative Call me at XXXX on a SUNDAY morning as I was trying to drive to Church. Get your payment processors to work on Sunday while the banks are closed!  I was incredibly offended by this nuisance, but more by the fact that the representative failed to properly verify my identity even by there own XXXX Controls! I am confident that I could call in again and not have my privacy protected adequately! This must stop because I am confident if this lack of regard for security happened to myself, a person whom has never missed a payment, I can only imagine it gets worse for those in collections, or those seeking to modify a loan.  I would like my credit report to reflect that I had not missed any payments, and I would like the CFPB to investigate and redress my claim against this careless company.  \"\n",

In Spring XXXX, Synchrony Bank announces via mail to all cardholders they will drop XXXX in exchange to form with new merchant, XXXX. The hardware store, Lowe \\'s, returned amount back to the XXXX card with the old account number, still under the same bank, Synchrony. 2 weeks later, a representative from Synchrony Bank said that they received an overpayment of an accredited amount to my name in the form of {$260.00}. She stated that in order to obtain back that money, I would have to go to Lowe \\'s for the refund. Upon discussing for refund, Lowe \\'s in-store customer service rep stated their refund policy recompenses are sent back to cards and stated that they no longer have that money and then said to re-check with credit card vendor. I then called Synchrony Bank customer services, after XXXX attempts to retrieve XXXX Card information regarding where this money supposedly refunded disappeared to, they finally said that they could not help me anymore. Synchrony Bank claims that since they are no longer with XXXX, they no longer have any responsibility on the whereabouts to where this money got funneled to. Not given an explanation or attendant to whom I could speak to help me find a contact to tracking down a solution, it \\'s hard not to feel helpless in this situation. Since XXXX is the only channel to get this refund back, I hold them fully responsible for not taking any capable action to at least assisting me to get this money back. I have no other alternatives, just a concerned customer having an issue with a card I make timely monthly payments to. Thank you for your time.  \"\n",

I applied on-line through the Southwest Airlines website by clicking on a banner advertisement. The banner clearly stated that if I successfully applied for a XXXX Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards credit card that I would be eligible for XXXX bonus points if I spent {$1000.00} in the first XXXX billing cycles. I read and re-read the credit card contract and offer multiple times and decided to apply. My application was instantly processed and approved. I received the credit card shortly and proceeded to use the card to meet the {$1000.00} spend requirements. Within the first billing cycle I achieved the spending requirements and awaited the addition of the XXXX bonus point to be added to my Southwest Rapid Rewards account. I was aware that there was a delay of XXXX to XXXX weeks to process the bonus. So, when my bonus miles did not get credited to my account after the first billing cycle I was not concerned. On XXXX/XXXX/15 a {$100.00} statement credit was applied to my Chase Visa card. This seemed faintly familiar since I believe it was also part of the XXXX Rapid Rewards credit card promotion. On XXXX/XXXX/15 my Rapid Rewards credit card was credited with XXXX points. In XXXX I had not seen the XXXX rapid rewards points credited to my account. I had operated under the impression that since the original offer was for XXXX points was for {$1000.00} spent in the first XXXX billing cycles. XXXX should have been the end of the first XXXX billing cycles and I had still not seen the credit. On XXXX XXXX I called Southwest Airlines at XXXX and spoke with a customer serviceperson. She explained that my points should be coming as soon as the next bill/cycle posted. On XXXX XXXX I used the automated website email and submitted the same question to them. Later that afternoon I received an email once again stating that reason for the delay was due to the XXXX to XXXX week processing time. On XXXX XXXX I called Southwest again and spoke to a customer service person and they said they will inquire directly with Chase Bank about the issue. On XXXX XXXX I got an email from Southwest stating that Chase Bank had denied that I signed up for the XXXX bonus points offer but that I had actually signed up for a different offer of XXXX bonus points and {$100.00} off your first credit card bill. I called Chase Bank directly at XXXX and stated to that this was incorrect and that I had clearly clicked on the banner for the XXXX bonus points offer. Chase denied that this was the case. Chase claims that I applied under the XXXX points / {$100.00} off XXXX statement offer. I asked to speak to a supervisor or a manager and they refused to put my call through but gave me a fax number. They stated that my claim would be denied even if I faxed a letter in.  \"\n",

Since I live XXXX miles from nearest agent and probably sent XXXX previous online transfer that is totally unacceptable.

I signed into PayPal and saw a note that the funds in that account were being held and that their system identified another account with a debt. This is the first time I have been told of this and found out not my a formal letter, nor any other communication until I received an email later on this AM. I contacted them concerning this \\\" other \\'\\' account and requested that information be provided to be in written form, and requested that my account be released. After being bounced around from limitations to the other office I finally was able to have a CS fill out a fraud claim. I informed them that 1 ) the XXXX informed me three years ago that my identity was stolen ; 2 ) I am a former XXXX on XXXX was was informed in XXXX that my information had been hacked. I also noted that I needed the funds to purchase my medications this afternoon. I was told that my case was being expedited and after a review they may release my money. If they were able to not do whatever they do, I would have no recourse legally. First off I was denied a formal letter with information to be able to review and dispute. Secondly, I was not given any notice or time about this. Thirdly, PayPal uses some algorithm which they do not share or do they provided to a consumer in written mailed out form. And lastly, the hold a consumer \\'s funds on the basis of this system and are not willing to provide the consumer anything about the situation. At this time I am waiting for PayPal to honor their promise to review, contact me, and lift the limitations on my account which not only apply to my funds, but by bank debit card, and another card which I am unable to anything with that information. In other words it they have taken hostage of my financial records and without due process of the law ; in some sense this action can be seen as harassing the consumer as it is a non-verbal threat in order to make the consumer pay a debt that they may or may not owe.  \"\n",

When I spoke with an agent, XXXX XXXX, in the office of the president, she maintained that the responses were, in a word, canned responses, and that the \\\" CFPB knows what we mean when we say we are unable to make contact.   As a consumer, I find it appalling that a company like Wells Fargo can get away with providing false and inaccurate information to a branch of the federal government, and if it is true that the CFPB \\\" knows what [ they ] mean \\'\\', I do not understand how it is possible that the CFPB is protecting consumers. It would seem that the CFPB is catering to the lenders and agents who are abusing consumers rather than taking these lenders to task over false and/or inaccurate information.   When I asked Wells Fargo to provide a clarification letter, they stated they would n\\'t because that was not how the \\\" CFPB wants [ them ] to communicate. \\'\\' Again, it would seem like the agency tasked with protecting consumers prefers to have inaccurate information provided to it versus forcing the lender or company to be truthful in their statements.  \"\n",

Since then, every employee has given me a different story on when the funds will be in my account. I \\'ve been told on three different occasions the funds were ACH \\'d into my account and would be available in a few business days. I was given other deadlines by two additional employees for when the funds would be available and those, too, have came and passed. The customer service representatives have no more information available to them than I do when viewing my application online, and I \\'m being told that the fate of these funds is in the hands of a funding department that no one can contact, has access to, or has a phone number for. A supervisor was supposed to get me a transaction tracking number and call me back, she never did. I spoke with another supervisor who told me the funds were approved XXXX XXXX, and I have yet to see them. At this point I think I was the victim of a fraudulent scam aimed to obtain personally identifiable information from consumers. The interest rate on my acceptance paperwork is actually higher than what I was approved for, and that paperwork says I have a payment due on XXXX XXXX, even though I never received a dollar from this company. At the very least, this is an inefficient, misleading, and dishonest company who flat out lies to consumers. Worst case scenario, it \\'s a complete scam.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"My Chase XXXX card was duplicated charge due to investigation error for the dispute.  The dispute for the charge was initiated on XX/XX/XXXX since merchant did n\\'t ship my order placed on XX/XX/XXXX on his promised shipping date. So this charge is invalid.  However Chase investigation was extended to the activities after XX/XX/XXXX. Chase only took into account that merchant has shipped his product on XX/XX/XXXX, but ignored the fact that I had made payment for this purchase on the same day.  About XXXX billing cycles passed since the dispute, I did n\\'t heard anything from Chase about dispute. on XX/XX/XXXX Chase sent a letter and stated that the charge on XX/XX/XXXX is valid.  I was asked whether to continue to dispute this charge, I submitted documents to prove that I paid for my purchase. On XX/XX/XXXX, the card service department person still argued that I should pay for my XXXX purchase. There is no such thing as XXXX purchase. I only made purchase once and had made payment, which is well documented.  The duplicated charge on my card is the result of unfair investigation. It is not the result as Chase card services explained as \\\" merchant processed duplicate transactions \\'\\'. Chase creditor should not transfer XXXX charge into my account.  Chronological record of dispute and transection:1. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX charged me {$3600.00} XXXX and promised to ship my order by XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX had no word regarding to my ordering status, and my monthly payment due date was approaching XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, I sent emails and made calls, did n\\'t get replying from him.  3. XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX replied and promised to send tracking number \\\" tomorrow \\'\\' which was supposed to be XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX still could n\\'t give the tracking number, which was one day before my payment due date, I asked for the dispute over the charge made on XX/XX/XXXX. Bank temporarily removed {$3600.00} from his account. At this point the charge is invalid since merchant did ship his merchandise to me.  5. XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX emailed tracking number, I made online payment for my purchase {$3600.00} XXXX XXXX ). He acknowledged that he received payment.  6. XX/XX/XXXX : before receiving my online paymentXXXX requested credit since the disputed funds was removed from his account. I authorized his charge {$3500.00} & {$180.00}, which reected total owed.for the merchandise {$3600.00} XXXX XXXX ).  7. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX realized that he charged me twice and performed refund on one of my payments, which is documented in his bank statement.  8. XX/XX/XXXX : my card balance is XXXX, which means I paid for my purchase, XXXX received payment and refunded his duplicated charges.  9. XX/XX/XXXX : Chase sent a letter and indicated that disputed amount will be in my next billing statement.  10. XX/XX/XXXX : I faxed back a letter indicated I wish to continue to dispute this charge, associated with the proof that I had paid to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX after receiving the tracking number.  11. XX/XX/XXXX : billing statement showed {$3600.00} charge on my credit card12. XX/XX/XXXX : a letter from Chase states \\\" we understand that you are asserting that merchant processed duplicate transactions and the merchant has promised to credit. \\'\\' This is a misleading statement. Merchant did processed duplicate transactions, however merchant did credit to his duplicated charge back to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. The duplicated charge is from the release of the temporary credit by Chase back to the merchant.  13. XX/XX/XXXX in Chase branch, through phone talked to card service department person, who insisted that I purchased twice and that is why I was charged XXXX. This is totally baseless.  14. XX/XX/XXXX,XXXXXX/XX/XXXX : discussed with card service executive XXXX She said Chase lost dispute to XXXX XXXX, that why the charge is on my account, which is unreasonable answer.  \"\n",

       "         value: \"My ex-husband opened an account for our XXXX child using his name and hers with Wells Fargo Bank. He subsequently has incurred a bank levy for unpaid registration fees on his vehicles. The levy attempted to garnish the account but there were no funds in the account so the bank assessed a {$120.00} processing fee for the levy. My ex-husband does not have legal or physical custody of XXXX our children. I went to the bank with my legal documents to have them remove our XXXX child from the account and they have said that while she is able to provide consent to be added on the account she is not able to revoke consent. They informed me that she can only be removed from the account by her father and the account can only be closed once the {$120.00} fee is paid because the account is for minors only. I do not agree with this position. She should be able to revoke consent to be a party on the account at any time, regardless of if the account is \\\" for minors \\'\\' or otherwise. She did not personally incur the levy on the account and so she should not be held responsible for her fathers poor financial choices. He, in my opinion, is unlikely to pay the levy or the processing fee and this account is likely to go to XXXX. If it comes to that, it will negatively affect her credit. She is a minor and she can not, in my opinion, grant legal consent to be engaged in financial transactions such as bank account creation. This is why minors are not allowed to open credit accounts.  \"\n",

He was trying to give me the wrong information by telling me that when someone fills out a \\\" pre-approved \\'\\' form, that the credit is not checked or viewed at all. I then told/ him that I know how it works and that I have applied for other credit cards with other banks and they have even told me that they view the credit to let me know if they can offer me a credit card or not, and based on that, they either state which credit card I can apply for or state that they can not offer me a credit card at that time. I stated to him that he was giving me the wrong information so that it did not appear that the bank had made a mistake, but that this was exactly the case. The bank made a mistake. He kept repeating the same thing so I told him that I would be filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so that you guys knew what they were doing to consumers. I told him that I want them to delete the hard inquiry from my credit report and he refused. So I am filing this complaint to request your assistance so the bank can delete the hard inquiry which should have never been there on the first place, had they not given me the wrong information at the pre-approval screen stating that I could apply for the Discover It credit card.  \"\n",

They stated quite clearly, and it was a topic of conversation for all the passengers near me, that if you apply in flight for the AAdvantage credit card that you will receive ( 2 ) Free Round Trip tickets anywhere in the continental US. Applications were distributed, I filled one out and returned it to the flight attendant.   Within about two weeks I received the credit card, made purchases and have paid my bill in full each time. However, I never received either frequent flyer miles or vouchers. I contacted XXXX XXXX multiple times by phone and via their website. I was not able to receive an acknowledgement of the underlying issue, nor a resolution. Two reference incidents were created : XXXX XXXXCustomer RelationsXXXX XXXX Ref # XXXX XXXXCustomer RelationsXXXX XXXXYour Reference number to this request : XXXXIn neither case, nor in phone calls made to the airline was a resolution provided. Finally, I publicly posted the issue on line and then received a response acknowledging the issue and direction to call the XXXX Credit Card company for resolution. Upon doing so they were notably more available and responsive, did the research but were unable to address or resolve the issue, nor provide any remedies.  It is clear now that this a false enticement was made to enter in a credit agreement, I think it is very important that the appropriate authorities are made away and that other consumers can avoid falling for the same credit fraud.  \"\n",

I have literally told this company over 50 times to stop calling me at work and call me after XXXX XXXX. I got so mad that I blocked the number. Now they are calling me from another number! I have told them every week this month to stop! They are being deceptive even though i have communicated with them and are paying something when I can.  They call when my bosses are in my office and are listening to me tell them not to call me at work. They have forced me to discuss my personal life with my bosses because of this, which makes me look bad! I do not know how to get them to stop! I have been nice, angry and nothing works. I \\'ve even spoken with a manager about this without a resolution. They promised me it was taken care of.  They are going to make me lose my job if I keep getting debt collector calls while I am working.  Please help!  \"\n",

       "         value: \"Closing was set for XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX.   Coldwell Banker Home Loans ( \\\" CB \\'\\' ) provided a Loan Estimate ( \\\" LE \\'\\' ) on XXXX/XXXX/15 after a new loan application was completed under the name of XXXX.   The previous application dated XX/XX/XXXX under the names XXXX and XXXX was denied. We received previous LEs under the joint application only ( with terms to expire XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX. ).   The loan number and interest rate remained unchanged but a new credit check on XX/XX/XXXX was performed. On the same day, CB provided a LE to XXXX.   All documents for this loan were viewed online with a time stamp stating when they were entered into the system and when viewed.   I received XXXX and Closing Disclosure ( \\\" CD \\'\\' ) on XXXX.   Closing costs were {$15000.00} on LE and {$10000.00} on CD. Cash needed for closing was {$4500.00} LE ; {$23000.00} on CD. On LE, Transfer taxes were {$2900.00} ; CD {$0.00}.   I emailed the loan originator, XXXX XXXX, to confirm {$23000.00} in a certified check on XX/XX/XXXX.   On XXXX at XXXX, our realtor sent us a DRAFT WITHOUT LENDER FEES Settlement statement from XXXX stating closing costs of {$21000.00}. I did not know what this form was and asked the realtor if this changed what we owed at closing. We received no response.   On XXXX/XXXX/15, I received ( but did not listen to it ) a voice message a XXXX to call XXXX. The message said \\\" I wanted to give you a call. Apparently there is an error on the closing disclosure that was provided to you guys by CB. It is one that is going to factor into your bottom line. It appears that you are going to need a good bit more money than what was disclosed on that statement as it appears that the transfer tax was left off. If you are available \\'\\' within 15 minutes we can today today.   I then received a call from CB \\'s Loan Processor, XXXX XXXX, at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX stating that we were all set for closing on the next morning at XXXX. I then listened to my XXXX voicemail from XXXX .   I called XXXX XXXX, she stated there was an updated CD that I was not provided. I asked for it again via email at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. It was never posted on the mortgage website. I was given updated CD at closing at XXXX.   I was uncomfortable going forward and stated these concerns. I proved CB the copies of the LE and CD and provided her information from the CFPB website as well as explained to her the applicable sections that her company was violating 1026.19 ( e ) and 1026.37. I reviewed with her what the CFPB states can change from the LE and what is actually paid at closing. I reviewed with her that there is zero tolerance to change transfer tax, 1026.19 ( e ) ( 3 ) ( ii ) and Comments 19 ( e ) ( 3 ) ( i ) -1 and -4.   XXXX XXXX gave this to her supervisor, XXXX XXXX ( phone number ( XXXX ) XXXX ). XXXX XXXX stated to us that is looked as if what they did was not right, but someone had to pay the additional transfer taxes today at closing. He stated if something was not right that he would personally resolve it within the 60-day time required. He had already spoken with the Vice President of the Closing Department- XXXX XXXX and they were discussing a resolution. He stated we proceed and he would follow-up the following week.   XXXX XXXX never contacted us again and disregarded our voicemails. I contacted XXXX XXXX and learned she no longer worked at CB.   On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX from the \\\" Office of the President \\'\\' of CB called to find out what happened. She stated that she would call us back on XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX with a resolution ; she did not. On XX/XX/XXXX, she said CB would give us {$250.00} CB violated the Dodd-Frank Act since they did not clearly disclose fees in an upfront, timely manner- always outside of the waiting period requirements. The Closing Company called us saying owed {$4800.00} more in costs due to change in transfer taxes because a CB employee omitted them.  \"\n",

They in turn issued me a loan at 21 % over 6 years at {$400.00} dollars. I am also required to keep full coverage on the vehicle. Perhaps I was too optimistic on my ability to repay the loan, but I have rapidly found out that this was a tremendous financial burden on my situation. Currently, I have been unable to afford my other debt obligations and these loans have become delinquent. I intend to do my best to maintain the car payment, however I am concerned that this loan may have been issued with the expectation that I would not be able to maintain what for me, is an aggressive repayment. I have attempted to contact the lender to discuss my situation. They have stated that they are currently unable to work with me but more importantly that they have no intention of working with me to achieve a long term resolution.  \"\n",

I have proof of XXXX successful payments, and an arrangement for auto-debited payments for XXXX more months. Navient went ahead and reported the pending past due amount to the credit bureau without informing me or my cosigner and thus greatly damaged our credit scores. This is unacceptable as I took proactive responsibility in making payment arrangements with Navient to avoid such actions. I was never informed by any agent or through the automated agreement over the phone, that the pending amount due would be reported. I was only told that once I made these XXXX payments, my account would be made present and start to reflect these new payments. My last successful payment was made on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and my pending amount due prior to arrangements is still saying it is past-due. It is impossible to find an agent who is fully informed on this process and this lack of cohesion reflects poorly on such a large corporation.  \"\n",

He then attempted to verify my address with what they had and they had the number off and the zip code. I have never received anything from this company about my debt. The representative XXXX XXXX then said his office only takes a full balance payment after he told me the payment was for XXXX. He said that included a {$300.00} assessment fee. So if i am correct that means my ticket was {$380.00} and the fee is almost a XXXX % penalty fine? He then told me, \\\" well you got the ticket 11 months ago \\'\\'. Once again I reminded him that I never received a notice of debt from XXXX XXXX, the fee was n\\'t on the ticket, and they had never sent me anything. To which he said \\\" by signing you acknowledge the fee \\'\\'. I also explained how i was calling in good faith to fix my fine, but he told me i could contact the court and they would tell me I had to contact them,. Basically I had no resource then to pay the fee. Please let me know what other resources i have. i do n\\'t have a problem paying the fine and a fee, but a assessment fee of almost XXXX % seems to me to excessive and I \\'m wondering if illegal.  \"\n",

Secondly to print an Experian credit report the consumer has to download Adobe software. A XXXX that links to the consumers computer.

When we checked 3 months ago it was not on any of the XXXX credit bureaus they said there was glitch in there system. They sent us a letter apologizing with a statement of our good standing. Now it is time to buy the house and they give us the run around. I have called XXXX XXXX and they state it is on their record but it still does not show on the print out. Drive time continues to say it will be down loaded with everybody \\'s. We do n\\'t care about anybody else at this point they have had 5 months to get this straight.
